[{"content":" Welcome to my gaming backlog reviews blog! I go through a variety of games from different eras and genres, from Super Nintendo and PlayStation, up to the most recently released titles. I mostly focus on retro, indies and double-A titles, more than big budget triple As, but I occasionally also play those aswel. My main platforms are the Steam Deck, a gaming PC and emulators. I also post my reviews on gaming backlog websites such as Backloggd and Grouvee.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/","section":"BackBlog","summary":"\u003ch3 style=\"color: rgba(255,255,255,0.5); font-weight: 100;\"\u003e\nWelcome to my gaming backlog reviews blog!\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./cover.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"mx-auto my-0 rounded-md\" /\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"BackBlog"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nInventive Kirby Anthology #This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library. Instead of presenting a single adventure, it offers a collection of smaller games that each explore different ideas, mechanics, and tones. This anthology approach keeps the experience constantly fresh, making even short modes feel meaningful because they contribute to a larger, varied whole. At first I thought this was a weird formula, but I ended up enjoying this very much, despite it being very exotic, making it feel like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be a mainline Kirby game in the first place. And this feeling is more related to other less polished games, which had lots of game modes to compensate for the lack of overall quality, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad to say this is not the case for this title.\nDynamic Copy Abilities #At the core of the game is Kirby’s copy ability, which has never felt more dynamic than it does here. Many abilities feature expanded move sets that borrow from fighting-game inputs, giving combat a surprising depth without sacrificing accessibility. The ability to create Helper characters from discarded powers introduces a cooperative element as well; when controlled by a second player, this system turns the game into a lively two-player experience that feels ahead of its time. Unfortunately I never experienced this, so I played the entire experience alone, and while I liked this mechanic, it really makes the game feel cluttered. Sometimes there is a lot going on on-screen that you get lost if you decide to engage with this mechanic, so I decided to very rarely use this.\nCharming SNES Presentation #The presentation is among the best on the SNES, with colorful visuals, expressive sprites, and smooth animations that bring the world to life. Each ability is carefully animated, and the environments feel vibrant and playful. This is no surprise for fans of this character since all of it\u0026rsquo;s games have the same very high level of quality and polish when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s minor details. Every character, especially Kirby, has a lot of animations and expressions, making them feel much more vivid, even though they are just 16-bit sprites moving around. The soundtrack is equally charming, packed with energetic themes that complement the game’s upbeat personality and have become iconic within the series.\nDistinct Game Modes #Each mode brings something unique: Spring Breeze acts as a gentle introduction, very traditional and I think it was my favorite. Dyna Blade offers light exploration and less focus on the combat. The Great Cave Offensive experiments with treasure hunting in a large interconnected environment, and you can definitely sink a lot of hours on this one if you want to 100% it, feels like a NG+ secret hunting. Revenge of Meta Knight introduces a fast-paced narrative with timed segments, and by far this was the most dynamic one, you even get a timer to each stage, similar to classic Mario titles. And Milky Way Wishes changes the rules by removing Kirby’s inhale ability and focusing on ability collection, and I admit that this was my least favorite one, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even finish this mode, I got frustrated trying to find the correct way to progress through the maps.\nTimeless Kirby Experience #My second least favorite is the racing one, too short, simple and easy, and while I like this aspect on most Kirby games, the racing mode simply never felt satisfying enough for me to try and get higher scores outside the minimum ones in order to progress further. Overall, this title remains one of the most inventive and polished platformers of its era. Its variety, strong mechanics, charming presentation, and cooperative gameplay give it exceptional replay value. Nearly three decades later, it still feels joyful, clever, and remarkably modern, it is definitely a must-play if you like Kirby to any extent. It is fairly short even, so there is very little reason not to try this, not to mention it got a lot of modes so you never get burn out of the gameplay loop.\n","date":"23 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kirby-super-star/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library.","title":"Kirby Super Star"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nVibrant Cultural Style #This title is a stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming into a uniquely charming package. Set in a cartoonish world inspired by Mexican folklore, the game immediately stands out with its bold color palette, expressive characters, and smooth animations. Everything, from the towns you visit to the supernatural landscapes you explore, feels handcrafted and full of personality, giving the adventure a lively and memorable identity. This is truly one of the most unique games when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s art-style, we sometimes take it for granted when we experience content inspired by other cultures. But this one is a big standout, not just because this is not a very well explored culture, but also when it comes to the overall quality and presentation, even when compared to more traditionally explored cultures such as the japanese/asian ones.\nDynamic Luchador Combat #Combat is both fast and satisfying, the MC is called Juan, a humble agave farmer turned luchador, and the moveset reflects that wrestling theme with hard-hitting throws, slams, and special attacks. The combo system encourages experimentation, letting you juggle enemies, switch targets mid-air, and weave in special abilities for extra power. As you progress, you unlock new moves that not only expand your offensive options but also serve as keys to explore previously inaccessible areas. This creates a rewarding loop of discovering upgrades, backtracking, and uncovering secrets that enrich the world. And despite it not being a hard game in general, it is still a very satisfying combat, with a lot of enemy variety and a balanced combo system, similar to even something like Devil May Cry or God of War.\nInventive Dimension Platforming #Platforming is another highlight, and the game uses its mechanics in inventive ways. One of the most distinctive features is the ability to switch between the “living” and “dead” dimensions, often in the middle of tricky jumps or enemy encounters. This mechanic keeps the platforming fresh and forces you to stay alert, especially in later stages where timing becomes crucial. It may not sound like a standout feature but, when you start playing while using this, you start to notice the game becomes much more complex overall, not just when it comes to the combat, but especially the platforming. Another standout to this mechanic is the fact that, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle, the development team had to recreate the entire game map due to the implementation of this mechanic, which is an incredible task. Puzzles are generally fair, with a good balance between reflex-based challenges and thoughtful navigation, they are as enjoyable as the combat or the platforming.\nPlayful Meta Humor #The humor throughout the game is lighthearted and self-aware, full of puns, visual jokes, and nods to video game culture. You can even notice some old memes from back in the day, immortalized on this piece of videogame, which is a nice nostalgia trip. NPCs frequently break the fourth wall, and the world is peppered with posters, signs, and side characters that add comedic flavor without feeling forced. It helps that the tone never takes itself too seriously; the story is simple but engaging, built around rescuing El Presidente’s daughter and defeating the skeletal villain Carlos Calaca. And since I live very close to Mexico I had a fond connection to this game\u0026rsquo;s culture because I experienced it in other places such as my childhood cartoons for example, I loved \u0026ldquo;¡Mucha Lucha!\u0026rdquo; as a kid.\nEnhanced Definitive Edition #This game improves on the original release by adding new areas, new enemy types, and additional difficulty options, making this version feel more complete and refined. It also supports local co-op, which turns the adventure into a fun, chaotic shared experience where teamwork actually enhances the platforming and combat. I played this with a friend for the first time, but we only reached half the game progress, then I decided to replay it from the beginning, alone, and almost 100% it. While the game still leans on repeated combat arenas and isn’t as long as some other Metroidvanias, its pacing remains brisk, and its mechanics stay entertaining from start to finish. I recommend trying to 100% this game, it has some amazing late-game content which enhances the experience. Since the overall journey is not really a hard one, the optional contents makes up for this with some platforming, combat and puzzle sections that are very challenging, even for veterans of the genre.\nA Timeless Metroidvania #Not to mention the classical secrets that makes up for the 100% factor, trying to find everything and do every side-quest feels like the intended way of experiencing this, similar to other titles of the same genre. Overall, this game is a polished, spirited, and highly enjoyable action-platformer. Its humor, art direction, and combat depth set it apart, while its clever level design and dimension-shifting mechanics keep the gameplay consistently engaging. Whether you’re a fan of Metroidvanias or just looking for a distinctive and energetic adventure, it remains one of the standout indie titles of its era. I consider this one of the best indie Metroidvanias that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, despite it\u0026rsquo;s age.\n","date":"21 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/guacamelee/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming.","title":"Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nEnhanced GBA Remake #This game was one of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld. At its core, it is a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2 (the version originally released in North America), but it isn’t just a simple port, it’s a significantly enhanced reimagining designed to feel fresh while still honoring the original. Visually, the game shines with bright, colorful sprites that make excellent use of the GBA’s hardware. Characters and enemies are more expressive, with smooth animations and added personality, like Mario’s exaggerated jump poses or Birdo’s lively attacks. The environments also feel richer and more detailed than on the NES, breathing new life into familiar levels.\nFaithful Yet Fresh Gameplay #I played the original back in the day but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the first few levels since it was too complex for me as a kid to understand, not to mention it works a bit differently than traditional Mario titles. The gameplay remains faithful to SMB2’s unique identity. You choose from Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, each with their distinct strengths, and progress through a mix of platforming and light puzzle-solving. The throwing mechanic, picking up enemies, vegetables, or objects, still gives the game a rhythm that sets it apart from traditional Mario titles. Controls are tighter than ever, and the GBA’s button layout makes the experience intuitive and responsive.\nRefined and Accessible #One of the most notable additions is the increased accessibility and refinement. The game offers more checkpoints, extra hearts, and improved enemy behavior, making it friendlier for newcomers without dumbing down the challenge. Your character has a number of hits it needs to take before dying, not just one or two like regular Mario, and you can also stack them if you play well enough. Whenever you actually die, you ca even switch characters on the fly, and play with the new one from the checkpoint forward. The newly added voice clips, sometimes amusing, sometimes repetitive, give the cast extra charm, even if they’re a bit campy. In my opinion this is the worst and best addition, by far, the voice-acting is so bad it is hilarious.\nWeak Soundtrack, Strong Package #As for the soundtrack, despite me being a fan of Nintendo on this regard, this game is by far one of the worst ones on this aspect. The OST is practically non-existent, it plays the same song over and over, on all levels, despite the character or boss that you are playing at the moment. Overall, this game is a warm, lively remake that successfully modernizes a classic while maintaining its quirky essence. Whether you’re revisiting SMB2 or discovering it for the first time, it remains a joyful and polished platformer that helped define the early GBA library. I recommend trying to 100% it since it is a fairly short play, it\u0026rsquo;ll help with this problem if you try to chase all secrets, not to mention playing as all the characters is also a fun addition, instead of focusing on just one.\n","date":"17 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-mario-advance/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld.","title":"Super Mario Advance"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nFPS/RPG Hybrid Roots #This title is a modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, and unlike most shooters of its time, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics, allowing you to interact with NPCs, engage in dialogue, and complete quest-like objectives. The game gives you a sense of choice in how they approach situations, whether through combat, negotiation, or exploration. The world of Strife is set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic industrial environment dominated by a sinister cult known as “The Order.” This narrative depth, combined with the your ability to affect outcomes through dialogue and quests, gives the game a more story-driven approach compared to many of its contemporaries, making it stand out in the mid-1990s shooter landscape.\nRevolutionary Remastered Return #And while it may not sound unique for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, this is fore sure one of the most revolutionary games of it\u0026rsquo;s time, there is nothing quite like this on this period of time in gaming. The Veteran Edition, released by Nightdive Studios (these folks are amazing), modernizes the original game to run on contemporary systems. It adds widescreen support, improved input options, and enhanced compatibility with modern operating systems, making it far easier to experience on current PCs, or PC Handhelds. The weapons, ranging from conventional firearms to more unique tools like the flamethrower or the mauler, offer you a variety of ways to approach combat encounters.\nChallenging Retro Exploration #I played it in the normal difficulty level and I still had a lot of challenge, especially because all the maps have a very high number of enemies, and they can quickly swarm you. The game’s design encourages exploration, and you are often rewarded for taking the time to search environments and talk to NPCs. For fans of retro gaming, these features help preserve the charm and identity of the original while making it accessible to modern audiences. Despite these improvements, Strife’s underlying engine, derived from the Doom engine lineage, shows its age. Level design can be confusing, with maze-like layouts that are sometimes difficult to navigate.\nAged Yet Charming Design #Enemy behavior is limited, and while the game offers multiple playstyles, many sections push you toward a more linear, combat-heavy approach. Some mechanics, such as stealth or negotiation, feel underdeveloped, and the interface can be clunky by modern standards. Visually, the game looks dated, and while the Veteran Edition smooths over technical issues, it cannot fully modernize the aesthetics of a mid-1990s game. Though for me personally I really like this aesthetic, so I cannot count this aspect of the game as a complete downside, there are quite good-looking titles nowadays which uses this art-style such as Ion Fury, for example.\nEnduring Retro Appeal #Overall, this game is a compelling experience for people interested in retro shooters or the history of FPS/RPG hybrids. It is not a polished, modern game, but it succeeds in preserving the spirit and atmosphere of the original. Its combination of narrative depth, exploration, and combat provides a nostalgic yet engaging experience, particularly for those willing to approach it with patience and a retro gaming mindset. For fans of classic games or those curious about the evolution of story-driven shooters, this one definitely remains a noteworthy and enjoyable title.\n","date":"13 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/strife-veteran-edition/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics.","title":"Strife Veteran Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Sci-Fi Mystery #This title is one of the most ambitious cinematic platformers of its era, a game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences. The MC is called Conrad B. Hart, a young agent who wakes up on an alien planet with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As the mystery unfolds, you piece together his identity and uncover a plot involving alien infiltration and political conspiracy. As much as the videogame industry is immensely saturated with amnesia tropes, this is without a doubt, one of the most unique experiences when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s narrative.\nRotoscoped Visual Mastery #On the SNES, Flashback retains the game\u0026rsquo;s signature rotoscoped animation, which was groundbreaking at the time. The team behind this displayed a great deal of evolution when it comes to their previous delivery, which was Out of This World (or, Another World), which both use the exact same art-style and animations. Every movement, from running and climbing to drawing your gun, is smooth and realistic, lending the game a unique cinematic quality. The environments are richly detailed, with futuristic cities, jungles, and alien landscapes that create a strong sense of atmosphere, even within the system’s limited color palette.\nDeliberate Platforming Challenge #As for the gameplay, it blends platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Unlike typical action games of the early ’90s, it rewards patience and observation over reflexes. Movement is deliberate and grid-based, meaning timing and precision are essential for climbing ledges, dodging traps, and engaging enemies. I advise an insane amount of patience when playing this, not only because of how old this game is, but even for the standards at the time, it\u0026rsquo;s implementation and genre makes it so that you get frustrated for trying to perform the utmost basic actions.\nTense Minimalist Combat #The combat is simple but tense, with your energy shield and pistol serving as your lifeline in a hostile world. There is but only a single weapon, with infinite ammo, and while this may sound appealing, you cannot go guns blazing. The shield can be recharged on certain areas, which is somewhat like a checkpoint for a quick breather, enabling you to be hit at least five times before the game-over screen. And lastly, later on in the game you\u0026rsquo;ll find an item that can stop enemy projectiles, making the combat a bit more dynamic from that point onward.\nAtmospheric Narrative World #Between the action, you’ll interact with NPCs, use items, and navigate dialogue sequences that feel more akin to an adventure game than a standard platformer. The story-telling is a highlight, told through cinematic cutscenes, mysterious journals, and Conrad’s own discoveries. It captures the tone of classic sci-fi films like Blade Runner and Total Recall, mixing cyberpunk aesthetics with philosophical undertones about identity and humanity. The music and sound design reinforce this mood, with atmospheric effects and a hauntingly minimalist soundtrack. This is one of the titles that helped define the \u0026ldquo;retro\u0026rdquo; landscape when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic. It is something that will stick to the back of your mind when you listen to things like Synthwave for example.\nTimeless but Demanding #That said, this is absolutely not an easy game, the controls can feel stiff and unforgiving to modern players, and trial-and-error is often required to progress. Still, mastering its rhythm is part of the appeal, it’s a product of an era when games expected you to learn through failure and persistence. Overall, this game remains a landmark in cinematic storytelling and animation in video games. Its combination of atmospheric design, thoughtful pacing, and sci-fi intrigue makes it a timeless experience, even if its dated controls and difficulty may deter newcomers. For fans of classic adventures and 16-bit experimentation, it’s a must-play piece of gaming history.\n","date":"9 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/flashback/","section":"Posts","summary":"A game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences.","title":"Flashback The Quest for Identity"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBittersweet Final Evolution #The 4th entry to the Mega Man Zero franchise marks the grand finale of the series, and it delivers one of the most refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA. This installment feels like both a mechanical evolution and a narrative closure. A game that understands exactly what made its predecessors great while ensuring Zero’s story ends on a powerful, bittersweet note. Even though it is quite a short title, it still tries to deliver a complete experience, not denying it is a handheld title, while at the same time taking itself serious enough for what it is trying to achieve.\nHope Amid Despair #Set after the events of Zero 3, the game finds Zero and Ciel’s resistance helping a group of human refugees escape Neo Arcadia’s oppressive rule to find peace on the surface. The plot carries a strong undercurrent of hope and despair, themes of sacrifice, humanity, and perseverance are woven throughout the dialogue and atmosphere. The story’s tone is more reflective, almost elegiac, as if the series itself knows the end is near. And this is a big shift compared to the previous entries, which focused more on characters than on the world and the plot behind it, more similar to the mainline entries of the Mega Man X series.\nRefined Combat Additions #As for the gameplay, it polishes the series’ trademark mix of fast-paced combat, precision platforming, and tactical customization. The standout addition is the Z-Knuckle, a versatile new tool that lets Zero steal and use enemy weapons, from guns and hammers to shields, adding a refreshing layer of variety and strategy. But I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t interesting enough for me to want to engage with it, so I barely even used it. I wish this new mechanic was more focused on the exploration aspect instead of the combat, it would make it more interesting. The weather system is another clever addition, each stage has two weather conditions that alter enemy behavior and hazards.\nChallenge and Rewards #And choosing the “harder” weather grants additional rewards, catering to people who crave challenge and replayability. Unfortunately I noticed this very late into the game, so I rarely managed to get the somewhat secret/extra optional abilities you get, and they are very well worth it, I recommend trying to unlock all of them. Difficulty, historically punishing in the series, is better balanced here, and I dare to say this is too easy sometimes. The new Cyber-Elf system consolidates previous games’ complex upgrade mechanics into a single, easier-to-manage entity, streamlining progression without oversimplifying it. Thought at the same time, it is quite toned down compared to the previous Z entries.\nTight Design Brilliance #Levels are tightly designed, emphasizing skillful movement and pattern recognition, while boss fights remain intense showcases of reflex and mastery. I really enjoyed that each ad every level has one sub-boss for you to fight, even the late-stage levels, this makes all this much more interesting when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s pacing. Visually, the game continues to push the GBA’s hardware to its limits with expressive sprite work, detailed environments, and smooth animations. Each stage bursts with color and mechanical detail, maintaining the gritty, post-apocalyptic tone that defines the series. The OST is equally memorable, as always, similar to the mainline X series, but with a more melancholic tone since this is what this series forever tried to convey.\nA Worthy Finale #This is most definitely a must-play if you like the Mega Man series to any extent, I recommend going for the re-releases for modern platforms since you can easily get a bundle with all the titles. But since I\u0026rsquo;m a try-hard, I played the original version instead, which is still enjoyable enough. And lastly, I feel that this title is the weakest of all of the Z franchise, similar to how I rank Mega Man X6, which is also a good fit to end the saga, but at the same time, you know it had way less attention than it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors.\n","date":"7 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-zero-4/","section":"Posts","summary":"This marks the grand finale of the series, a refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA.","title":"Mega Man Zero 4"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 95 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Sequel Reimagined #This title, by Team Cherry, is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight. After years of speculation, delays, and fervent community anticipation, Silksong emerges not just as a continuation of Hollow Knight’s legacy but as a reimagining of what a sequel can be. It carries forward the spirit of discovery, challenge, and melancholy beauty that defined the original while reshaping the formula around its new protagonist, one of the bosses in the first title, Hornet. This time around the location of the world is called Pharloom, so we are no longer in Hallownest. It inverts the descent into darkness of the first game, challenging you to ascend through layered environments, each brimming with its own mysteries, dangers, and emotional weight.\nHornet’s Agile Gameplay #From the first moment you take control of Hornet, it’s clear that this sequel moves to a different rhythm. Where the Knight of the first game felt methodical and grounded, Hornet is quick, acrobatic, and expressive. Her needle and thread weapon serve as both a tool for combat and traversal, allowing her to dash across gaps, pull herself toward enemies, and weave through combat scenarios with a balletic grace. I had two feelings regarding the first few mechanic introductions, one is the pogo, the initial downward strike is very hard to master, and second, that the very welcoming addition of edge grabbing. The controls are tight and responsive, rewarding precision and timing in a way that feels immediately satisfying, and this shift in movement philosophy changes the entire tone of the game.\nPharloom’s Vertical Beauty #The new Pharloom region feels both alien and familiar, echoing the quiet sadness of Hallownest while introducing a fresh aesthetic variety. The environments are more vertical, emphasizing Hornet’s agility and this makes you think more multi-dimensionally. Each biome, tells its own story through architecture and ambient detail, which is an inheritance of games such as Dark Souls. Every corner hides a secret, and every vista carries the haunting beauty that has become Team Cherry’s signature art-style. The game’s visual presentation remains hand-drawn, filled with fluid animations and a painterly sense of color and light that makes each area distinct and memorable. And similar to the first title, it heavily relies in the use of the parallax effect in order to create a sense of immersion.\nA Haunting Soundscape #This game OST, once again, plays a central role in defining its emotional landscape. Somber strings and delicate piano melodies evoke a sense of longing and loss, while tense, rhythmic compositions drive the intensity of boss encounters. The soundtrack shifts dynamically as you explore, adding layers of atmosphere that deepen the sense of immersion. So no big changes from the first entry, it retains the exact same style and level of quality. It’s not merely background music, it feels like an emotional partner to the journey, guiding you through her trials and triumphs. And again, similar to the first title, it\u0026rsquo;s OST it\u0026rsquo;ll also be on my of playlists, alongside others such as Deltarune, Undertale and the Mega Man series. The boss themes are also amazing, especially ones like Karmelita and Lace. Unfortunately, the Hornet\u0026rsquo;s theme is dedicated to the first game, so we never get to hear it on this entry, though I think that it is what the bosses hear whenever we start a fight with them.\nRefined Core Systems #As for the gameplay, it strikes a delicate balance between evolution and tradition. Many of the core systems from Hollow Knight return, exploration, platforming, and combat remain tightly interwoven, but they’ve been refined to suit Hornet’s more energetic playstyle. Healing now requires the use of silk rather than soul, adding a new dimension of risk and reward. And I think that the healing mechanic now is much more fun since it gives you more options, such as doing it while in movement. Crafting replaces charms, letting you forge tools and upgrades that better suit their preferred approach. The result is a system that feels more customizable and experimental. There’s a greater variety of weapons, movement abilities, and environmental puzzles, ensuring that every new zone introduces something mechanically fresh.\nExpanded World Scale #I noticed a lot of people disliking the more limited approach (more balanced, really) to this system, but I think it served this game better since Hornet is more capable than the Knight, already being powerful without any upgrades. One of its most noticeable improvements lies in its sense of scale, Pharloom is significantly larger than Hallownest, with more interconnected pathways, secret areas, and optional challenges. And at the same time, Hollownest was already immense, so be prepared for at least double the amount of exploration. The game world feels alive with characters, many of whom have their own side quests, stories, and moral complexities. These interactions add depth to the narrative without sacrificing the trademark ambiguity that made the original so captivating.\nDifficulty and Mastery #The writing is subtle but emotionally resonant, you feel the weight of the world’s history in every ruined chapel, forgotten grave, and whispered line of dialogue. Even though it follows the game\u0026rsquo;s unique spoken language, you still feel and understand the emotions of the characters since the voice-acting is phenomenal. Despite these strengths, Silksong is not without its frustrations. Its difficulty curve is steep, being even harder than the first title, which is already very hard in the first place. Boss battles, while exhilarating and expertly designed, often require dozens of attempts to master. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough when I say that your brain will be used to it\u0026rsquo;s maximum level when you engage in the boss fights, some of them are so hard that it feels like time has stopped. Enemy attacks are faster and more aggressive, demanding sharper reflexes and deeper understanding of movement mechanics. Not to mention that you now receive twice as much damage, from the very beginning of the game, making you an even more glass cannon character than the Knight.\nPunishing Yet Rewarding #The game also inherits the punishing “run-back” system from its predecessor, dying can mean long treks back to your shade and another attempt at survival. And while I sometimes agree that this is a drawback since other similar games are no longer doing this, such as Elden Ring itself, some may even consider this a QOL improvement. A this can be a satisfying test of skill, for others, it may verge on exhausting. I only really had any trouble with this on one particular boss called Groal The Great, otherwise, all the other ones are very tolerable. Still, when you finally conquer a brutal boss or uncover a hidden area, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.\nEpic Personal Journey #As for the narrative, it feels both intimate and epic, Hornet’s story is one of resilience and self-discovery, told not through heavy exposition but through the quiet spaces between action. And while the first game already set very high standards, and hyped up her backstory, in my opinion, it still managed blow away all my expectations. Her journey up through Pharloom mirrors you own growth as a player, from disoriented captive to agile master of her environment. Themes of rebirth, sacrifice, and legacy resonate throughout the experience, connecting Silksong to its predecessor while carving out a unique emotional identity. By the time the credits roll, it feels less like a sequel and more like a spiritual ascension of everything Hollow Knight represented. While at the same time (some spoilers now), the very first time you face the credits is just half the journey, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle.\nA Metroidvania Triumph #It is absolutely a must to 100% this game, I admit that I didn\u0026rsquo;t played the Steel Soul mode, but I at least performed 100% of the game\u0026rsquo;s contents like challenges, side-quests and optional bosses. Ultimately, this game justifies every minute of its long development cycle, it is a masterclass in game design, a seamless blend of art, challenge, and storytelling that captures the soul of the Metroidvania genre while expanding its boundaries. It’s more demanding than ever, but also more rewarding. It invites you to lose themselves in its intricate world, to learn through failure, and to find meaning in perseverance. For newcomers, it offers a beautiful yet brutal introduction to one of gaming’s most artful universes. For veterans, it’s the culmination of everything they loved about Hollow Knight, faster, sharper, and richer in every sense.\nA Defining Masterpiece #Hollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the defining games of 2025, a title that will be discussed, analyzed, and revered for years to come. It may not be flawless, but its imperfections only underline its ambition and humanity. Few games so confidently balance elegance and difficulty, serenity and chaos, despair and triumph. Team Cherry has once again created something timeless. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of all time, an a must-play if you like games to any extent, similar to the first entry. Not to mention it is easy to get your hands on it since the team decided to use regional prices, yet again setting new standards, not just to the game quality and it\u0026rsquo;s indie scope, but also when it comes to how it\u0026rsquo;s audience is treated.\nAn Unforgettable Experience #I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this enough, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be better experienced if you play the first game before going to this one. And trust me, half an hour playing the first Hollow Knight will be enough to get you hooked and you won\u0026rsquo;t notice that, out of nowhere, you played more than 20 hours and there is still a lot to see in the game. For my gameplay session I took two entire months, playing it to it\u0026rsquo;s entirety, doing 100% of the content (minus Steel Soul Mode) and I took 110 hours, more than double the amount of the first game. I can\u0026rsquo;t praise this game enough, I consider this to be the most advanced of indie titles, this is the most polished and has the highest level of quality we got up until this point in time. And despite it having a target audience and it\u0026rsquo;s own genre, I still recommend this if you are not familiar with Metroidvanias, just expect an insane level of challenge if you haven\u0026rsquo;t even touched the previous game.\n","date":"5 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hollow-knight-silksong/","section":"Posts","summary":"The long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight.","title":"Hollow Knight Silksong"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nUndead Revenge Unleashed #This title is a remaster of the 1997 cult-classic shooter Blood, by Nightdive Studios. It updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions, widescreen support, smoother performance, and improved compatibility with current hardware, while keeping its signature fast-paced and gory gameplay intact. The MC is called Caleb, an undead gunslinger out for revenge, battling cultists, zombies, and grotesque monsters across a series of cleverly designed levels filled with secrets and dark humor.\nFaithful Blood Restoration #The game’s biggest strength lies in how faithfully it preserves the spirit of the original. Weapons like the flare gun, dynamite bundles, and the voodoo doll remain just as satisfying to use, and the level design still stands out as some of the best from the Build engine era. The atmosphere, blending horror, comedy, and chaotic action, holds up very well. It also bundles in the two official expansions, Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, offering plenty of content for both newcomers and returning fans.\nA Brutal Revival #I highly recommend playing these extra content, they are well worth it, despite the main game being somewhat longer than it needs to be, so maybe come back later to finish it another opportunity. However, not everything is perfect, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice slight differences in movement, weapon behavior, and difficulty balance compared to the original version, making it feel “off” in subtle ways. Overall, this game is a successful revival of one of the best shooters of the 90s. It’s brutal, stylish, and has a lot of replay value, combining old-school charm with modern accessibility.\nBoomer Shooter Masterclass #This shooter is truly one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind, it\u0026rsquo;s originality alone carry the game forward, even if you are not a fan of shooters. Despite it being considered a boomer shooter cult-classic nowadays, it has a varied way of playing it with the amount of different weapons you can play around with. Not to mention it\u0026rsquo;s enemies and level design force you to be creative and use all of them in order to maximize your chance if not dying, because trust me, it\u0026rsquo;ll happen a lot. For fans of retro FPS games, this is definitely a must-play, just expect a tough, unforgiving experience that stays true to its roots.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/blood-fresh-supply/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remaster of the 1997 title, by Nightdive Studios, it updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions.","title":"Blood Fresh Supply"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHand-Painted Metroidvania Charm #This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences. The game immediately stands out with its hand-painted backgrounds, fluid character animations, and richly detailed environments, which give it a distinctive, almost storybook-like aesthetic. Every area feels vibrant and alive, from lush forests to eerie caves, and the attention to visual detail demonstrates the dedication from the development team. The OST complements the visuals beautifully, offering melodic themes that enhance both exploration and combat, creating a captivating atmosphere throughout the journey.\nFluid, Accessible Combat #As for the combat, it is responsive and satisfying, featuring a combination of melee attacks, magic, and the assistance of Fidget, a small, flying companion who adds an extra layer of strategy. Early encounters feel engaging, and the progression system allows you to unlock new abilities and upgrades, giving the gameplay a sense of growth. The game is also accessible, with controls that feel intuitive, making it easy for newcomers to dive in without feeling overwhelmed. The pacing is generally well-balanced, alternating between exploration, platforming, and combat encounters to keep the experience fresh.\nMystery-Filled Hero’s Journey #The narrative follows Dust, a mysterious warrior on a journey to uncover his past, accompanied by Fidget and other colorful characters. While the story provides enough context to drive the adventure, some may find the writing and voice acting uneven. Though in my opinion, this is an acceptable level of quality due to the fact that this title was developed by a single person. Dialogue can occasionally feel forced or simplistic, and certain plot points are predictable, but the character designs and world-building help maintain engagement. Side quests and hidden areas encourage exploration. I encourage this game to be played 100% since it isn\u0026rsquo;t very long and there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of side-quests, so each and every single one of them is a significant and worthwhile experience.\nImpressive Solo-Dev Achievement #For an indie game developed primarily by one person, the ambition, polish, and charm are remarkable, making it a standout in its genre. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted, engaging action-platformer that combines fluid combat, gorgeous visuals, and a charming world. While it may not challenge hardcore people with deep mechanics or complex level design, it offers a highly enjoyable experience for fans of 2D adventure games and indie titles. Its accessibility, style, and polished presentation make it a memorable journey that is well worth experiencing.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/dust-an-elysian-tail/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences.","title":"Dust An Elysian Tail"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nGex Goes 3D #This title is a 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody, and the era’s fascination with mascot adventures. It’s the second entry in the Gex series and marks the character’s leap from his 2D origins on the 3DO into a fully 3D world, following in the footsteps of titles like Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot.\nChannel-Hopping Adventure #The MC is called Gex, a sarcastic, television-obsessed gecko recruited by a secret agency to once again stop his nemesis, Rez. The game’s levels are designed around TV “channels,” which serve as themed worlds parodying various genres, from cartoons and horror to sci-fi and spy movies. This framing gives the game a playful sense of variety and self-awareness that stands out even today.\nCollectibles and Chaos #Each world is filled with collectibles, hidden power-ups, and plenty of slapstick humor. Gex’s moveset, including tail whips, tongue grabs, and wall climbs, gives the you solid control, though the camera can sometimes make platforming frustrating. Still, for its time, the controls were ambitious and contributed to the game’s open-ended exploration style.\nToo Many One-Liners #The biggest draw is Gex himself, voiced by comedian Dana Gould, Gex constantly cracks jokes, references pop culture, and mocks TV clichés. Depending on your tolerance, his one-liners can be either charmingly nostalgic or grating after a while, but they undeniably give the game personality. Personally I got annoyed quite fast because the frequency that this happens is very high, taking me out of the focus of the gameplay.\nMascot of an Era #And while this title hasn’t aged as gracefully as some of other Gex entries, it remains a fun, distinctive snapshot of the PlayStation era. With imaginative level design, sharp humor, and a memorable mascot at its center, it’s a game that feels both dated and delightfully emblematic of the time when every studio wanted its own wisecracking animal hero. I would only recommend this one if you are a fan of Gex, or mascot games in general.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gex-enter-the-gecko/","section":"Posts","summary":"A 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody.","title":"Gex Enter the Gecko"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nWhimsical Gothic Adventure #This MediEvil sequel is a delightful and whimsical action-adventure game that successfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. You once again play as Sir Daniel Fortesque, the skeletal hero with a heart of gold, in a quest that blends humor, gothic charm, and lighthearted adventure. The game’s setting, a richly imagined, slightly spooky version of Victorian England, is filled with cleverly designed levels that balance platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. Each area is bursting with personality, from eerie graveyards to bustling towns, and populated by a variety of quirky and memorable enemies.\nStylized Charm and Combat #One of the game’s strongest points is its visual design. The characters and environments are highly stylized, combining gothic horror elements with a playful cartoonish quality that makes the game approachable and endlessly charming. The OST complements this aesthetic perfectly, featuring catchy, atmospheric tunes that enhance both the humor and tension of the adventure. The combat is more refined than in the first game, with a mix of melee weapons and ranged options that keep encounters fresh, though some camera angles and movement controls occasionally feel awkward by today’s standards. I found myself using the extra combat mechanics way more than the first entry, which I mostly relied in using the regular sword slashes.\nChallenge, Secrets, Rewards #As for the complaints, there are a few boss fights, particularly the one against the Iron Slugger, which is ridiculously hard, to the point that there is but a single way of beating him. Exploration and discovery are heavily rewarded. Secret areas, hidden items, and collectible relics encourage you to thoroughly explore every nook and cranny, adding depth to the experience. The game also does a great job of balancing challenge with accessibility, making it enjoyable for both newcomers and fans of the original. With its combination of clever level design, charming storytelling, and a perfect balance of humor and heroism, this game stands as a memorable entry in the PlayStation library.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/medievil-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A delightful and whimsical action-adventure that successfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor.","title":"MediEvil II"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Samurai Sequel #The second entry to the Onimusha franchise is a remarkable sequel that successfully expands on the foundation laid by the original entry. Set once again in a dark, demon-infested version of feudal Japan, the MC this time is called Jubei Yagyu, a wandering samurai seeking revenge after his village is destroyed by the forces of the demonic warlord Nobunaga Oda. From the opening cinematic, it sets an intense tone, combining historical fiction with supernatural horror and stylized action in a way that feels distinctly cinematic for its time.\nCombat, Choice, Consequence #Gameplay revolves around tight sword-based combat and puzzle-solving in richly detailed pre-rendered environments. The combat system is simple but satisfying, timing parries and using elemental weapons against demons feels fluid and rewarding. Jubei can also absorb the souls of fallen enemies to upgrade weapons and items, a system that gives a light RPG flavor to the otherwise linear progression. One of the major additions in this sequel is the ally system, throughout the story, Jubei can interact with several supporting characters, and his choices, gifts, dialogue, and actions, influence who will join him and how the story unfolds. This feature adds replayability and emotional depth rarely seen in early 2000s action titles.\nAtmospheric Feudal Horror #Visually, the game is stunning for its era, with gorgeously designed backdrops, expressive character models, and cinematic cutscenes that still hold up in terms of atmosphere. The haunting OST and high-quality voice acting enhance the game’s dramatic tone. While this game retains the fixed camera angles and tank-style movement of survival horror titles like Resident Evil, these elements can feel dated or clunky by modern standards. However, they also contribute to the game’s tension and visual storytelling, framing scenes like moments from a film.\nAmbitious, Resonant Continuation #Overall, this sequel is a worthy continuation of the series, deeper, more ambitious, and more emotionally resonant than its predecessor. It’s a blend of action, atmosphere, and mythic storytelling, and it remains a must-play for fans of samurai epics and classic PS2-era action games. I tried to finish this in the original hardware back in the day, but bad resource management and hard boss fights prevented me from doing so, not to mention I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understood the ally system, which can make or break your playthrough.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/onimusha-2-samurai-destiny/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remarkable sequel that successfully expands on the foundation laid by the original entry.","title":"Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nExistence Beneath the Waves #This title is a deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread. Set in the decaying underwater facility PATHOS-II, the game thrusts you into a haunting narrative about identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human. The MC is called Simon Jarrett, an ordinary man who, after a brain scan in 2015, wakes up decades later in a mysterious research station at the bottom of the ocean. As he explores the flooded corridors and abandoned laboratories, Simon uncovers disturbing truths about humanity’s extinction and the desperate attempts of the station’s AI and its former inhabitants to preserve consciousness through technology.\nHorror Through Philosophy #The narrative is gripping, unfolding through environmental storytelling, computer logs, and tense dialogue that gradually reveals a terrifying yet thought-provoking picture of the world. Unlike most horror games, it doesn’t rely on jump scares or gore. Instead, its horror comes from philosophical unease, the blurred boundaries between humans and machines, the loss of self, and the nature of existence without physical form. It’s a game that makes you question your own identity and morality as you make difficult choices with no clear right answers. Despite all this, the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have any moral or decision making mechanics, which is unfortunate since it could improve it\u0026rsquo;s replay value.\nOppression in the Deep #Visually, it captures the oppressive isolation of the ocean floor perfectly. The lighting and sound design work hand-in-hand to build an atmosphere of suffocating tension. You can hear the creak of metal under pressure, the distant hum of machinery, and the distorted cries of something that used to be human. The art direction is superb, combining gritty industrial realism with eerie sci-fi surrealism. The gameplay is mostly exploratory, interspersed with stealth sections where you must avoid hostile creatures. These segments are among the game’s weaker points, you may find them frustrating or at odds with the otherwise slow, meditative pace. Fortunately, the later-added Safe Mode allows you to experience the story without worrying about being attacked, making it ideal for those more interested in the narrative than the horror mechanics.\nTranscendence and Identity #What makes this title stand out the most is its emotional and intellectual resonance. It’s less about surviving monsters and more about confronting what happens when humanity transcends, its own physicality. By the time the credits roll, most people are left reflecting on questions that linger long after the screen goes dark. In short, this game is a masterful fusion of science fiction and psychological horror. It’s a slow, heavy, and deeply affecting experience that rewards patience and introspection. If you value atmosphere, storytelling, and existential themes over action, this is a game that will stay with you.\nA Heavy, Masterful Journey #This game is not for everyone, it is one of the heaviest titles that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and if you are not a fan of this kind of game than I would stay away from this one. I would also recommend not playing this is you have a hard time with horror experiences, because despite me considering myself almost bullet-proof when it comes to these games, I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a walk in the park. Ultimately, this is truly one of the best games of it\u0026rsquo;s genre, it showed how the Amnesia team evolved in absolutely every way possible, especially when it comes to story-telling and writing, I consider this a must-play not just if you like horror titles, but also if you like thought provoking stories.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/soma/","section":"Posts","summary":"A deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread.","title":"SOMA"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBirth of Stylish Combat #The very first entry to the Devil May Cry franchise is widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre. The MC is called Dante, a charismatic and cocky demon hunter on a mission to defeat the powerful demon Mundus and unravel the mysteries of his own past. From the very first moments, the game sets a dark, gothic tone with its foreboding castle setting, intricate level design, and cinematic cutscenes that feel almost like interactive movies. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly rewarding, blending swordplay, acrobatics, and gun combat.\nStyle-Driven Action Mastery #You can chain together elaborate combos, juggling enemies in the air and switching seamlessly between melee and ranged attacks. It encourages you to fight with style, awarding rankings from “D” to “Stylish” based not just on survival, but on creativity, speed, and variety in combat. And despite score systems being a common thing in nowadays gameplay design, the more dynamic, unique and full of personality one like the first DMC\u0026rsquo;s implementation was a standout back in the day. Boss battles are particularly memorable, often requiring both skill and strategy, and each one feels like a true test of mastery.\nInnovative Combat Foundations #The controls and combat systems were innovative for their time, giving you a sense of freedom and power rarely seen in early 2000s action games. The OST complement the intense action, from epic orchestral pieces to edgy rock tracks, further enhancing the experience, though I think that this very first DMC had a more shy style for it\u0026rsquo;s songs when compared to subsequent entries. While some people might find the difficulty steep and the camera occasionally challenging, these aspects also add to the sense of accomplishment when battles are won.\nA Genre-Defining Legacy #Beyond gameplay, this game established a lasting legacy with its over-the-top style, memorable protagonist, and influence on countless action titles that followed. It spawned a franchise that continues to be celebrated today, and its blend of challenge, style, and narrative depth makes it a standout title on it\u0026rsquo;s platform that still holds up remarkably well. This is truly one of the milestones in gaming history, especially when it comes to this genre, a must-play if you have the opportunity to experience this in modern platforms. Despite my high praise on this title, I still think this sits in the weak spot of the franchise, though not in a bad way, but simply because it\u0026rsquo;s sequels improved upon it\u0026rsquo;s foundations much more that makes the OG DMC a little gray in comparison.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/devil-may-cry/","section":"Posts","summary":"A widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre.","title":"Devil May Cry"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
