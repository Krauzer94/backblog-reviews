[{"content":" Welcome to my gaming backlog reviews blog! I go through a variety of games from different eras and genres, from Super Nintendo and PlayStation, up to the most recently released titles. I mostly focus on retro, indies and double-A titles, more than big budget triple As, but I occasionally also play those aswel. My main platforms are the Steam Deck, a gaming PC and emulators. I also post my reviews on gaming backlog websites such as Backloggd and Grouvee.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/","section":"BackBlog","summary":"\u003ch3 style=\"color: rgba(255,255,255,0.5); font-weight: 100;\"\u003e\nWelcome to my gaming backlog reviews blog!\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./cover.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"mx-auto my-0 rounded-md\" /\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"BackBlog"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nProcedural Retro Appeal #This title is a retro-styled Metroidvania that aims to blend procedural generation with classic side-scrolling exploration. Its presentation is immediately appealing, the pixel art is detailed and expressive, giving each environment a warm, handcrafted look despite the fact that the rooms are assembled procedurally. At first I was concerned regarding the game\u0026rsquo;s quality, because using random content generation approaches never usually deliver a good experience. Most titles lack the quality level of hand-crafted environments. But I can safely say this is not the case, every biome feels unique, exploration feels organic, at least to a certain degree. Animations are smooth, the color palette is vibrant without feeling overwhelming, and the game succeeds in evoking the feel of 16-bit era adventures.\nAtmospheric Exploration Loop #The soundtrack reinforces this mood, offering calm, melodic tracks that support exploration without distracting from it. Though it is not as fantastic as other titles of the same genre, this one only tries to fill the silence instead of enforcing a musical identity. As a Metroidvania, it delivers the expected staples, you’ll traverse interconnected regions, defeat enemies, collect upgrades, and return to previously inaccessible areas as your abilities expand. The controls are responsive, and platforming feels comfortable, even if it doesn’t demand high precision. The town-rescue element, where you free villagers who then return to the hub area, adds a sense of progression outside raw exploration. This is clearly inspired by games like Order of Ecclesia and Soul Blazer, and I highly recommend trying to do all the side-quests, it\u0026rsquo;ll greatly help you with progression.\nVaried Gear, Mixed Structure #There’s also a decent variety of weapons and equipment, giving you room to adapt combat to their preferences, whether focusing on faster attacks, heavy hits, or defensive boosts. Particularly I decided to stick to the basics, so I learned how to use the basic starting sword, and tried to use weapons similar to it, from start to finish. However, the game’s reliance on procedural generation is both a distinguishing feature and a limitation. While the curated room templates maintain a baseline level of quality, the way these pieces are stitched together can make the world feel loosely assembled rather than intentionally crafted. This reduces the sense of memorable landmarks or intricate pathways that often define the best Metroidvanias. The result is a map that is fun to uncover but rarely surprising or tightly structured.\nRepetitive Yet Steady Combat #Combat is straightforward and initially enjoyable, but it doesn’t evolve much over time. Enemy patterns are simple, and encounters tend to repeat across areas, which can flatten the challenge curve. Boss battles provide some variety and spectacle, yet they are not numerous enough to compensate for the general repetitiveness of regular fights. The pacing also leans toward the slow and methodical, people seeking intense combat or rapid progression might find the adventure somewhat subdued. You can enhance the combat by upgrading your gear and abilities, but unfortunately this only starts to feel good by the late-game, which makes it sound like you should go for a NG+ mode.\nCozy, Modest Adventure #And while a new game plus mode doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist on this game, I believe trying to 100% it, like I did, is good enough for it\u0026rsquo;s small indie scope. Despite these shortcomings, this game remains an appealing experience for those who value atmosphere and exploration over mechanical depth. Its charm lies in its classic feel, gentle progression, and cozy presentation. The game doesn’t attempt to redefine the genre, but it delivers a steady, pleasant adventure that’s easy to settle into. For those willing to accept its modest ambitions, this title offers a satisfying journey that echoes the spirit of older Metroidvania titles, even if it never quite reaches the heights of its inspirations.\n","date":"9 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/chasm/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a retro-styled Metroidvania that aims to blend procedural generation with classic side-scrolling exploration.","title":"Chasm"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nTactical Hostage Gameplay #This title is a relatively obscure action-adventure game that attempted to combine tactical gameplay with a hostage-rescue narrative. You control an elite commando team sent to infiltrate a skyscraper taken over by terrorists, with the goal of saving hostages and neutralizing threats. One of it\u0026rsquo;s most notable features is the ability to switch between multiple characters, each with distinct abilities and combat styles. It almost makes you feel like you are playing a party RPG, since all the character have vastly different playstyles, about all that is missing is a progression system and a less simplistic combat system. This mechanic encourages you to approach situations strategically, rather than relying on a single playstyle, and adds a layer of depth that distinguishes it from many other action games of the era.\nExploration And Frustration #The levels themselves include a mix of exploration and puzzle-solving, requiring you to navigate the building, unlock doors, and locate hostages while avoiding or confronting enemies. And the enemies respawn indefinitely, but they give you a fair amount of breathing room so you don\u0026rsquo;t get tired of this, while also giving you more resources when you defeat them. Despite its promising premise, the game suffers from several major drawbacks. The controls are widely considered cumbersome, with slow movement and tank-like handling that make combat and navigation frustrating. While I don\u0026rsquo;t really get bothered much by tank controls, they are very bad on this game, your character tries to avoid obstacles on it\u0026rsquo;s own, automatically, and this is a recipe for disaster. Aiming and attacking often feel unresponsive, which can turn tense moments into tedious struggles.\nWeak AI And Story #Enemy AI is weak and predictable, and encounters frequently lack challenge or engagement. The hit detection can also be inconsistent, further undermining combat satisfaction. These gameplay issues are compounded by a story and presentation that fail to leave a strong impression. Dialogue is generic, voice acting is underwhelming, and the characters themselves are mostly forgettable, making it difficult for you to become invested in the narrative or the team they control. At the same time, at this point in time in gaming history, not all games were mature enough. So I don\u0026rsquo;t fault this one for not having a better quality overall, but I can safely say that it can sometimes be laughable to experience, such as the cutscenes. On the positive side, this game offers a certain retro charm that may appeal to collectors and fans of early PlayStation experimentation.\nMixed Mechanics, Low Replay #The concept of managing a small team with different skills is interesting and provides some variety in how missions are approached. Additionally, the game’s combination of action and light puzzle elements gives it a slightly different flavor compared to other PS1 titles focused solely on combat or horror. However, the lack of polish and the frustrating control scheme significantly limit its appeal. Replay value is minimal, as missions can feel repetitive and there is little incentive to revisit completed levels. In conclusion, this title is a flawed but curious piece of PlayStation history. It shows ambition in its tactical team mechanics and hostage-rescue premise, yet it is held back by clunky controls, weak combat, and uninspired presentation.\nRetro Appeal Only #For people who enjoy retro PS1 games and are curious about lesser-known titles, it may offer a nostalgic experience. However, for those seeking tight gameplay, intelligent AI, or a compelling story, T.R.A.G. is unlikely to provide a satisfying experience. It remains more of a historical curiosity than a hidden gem in the PlayStation library. I would only invest any time on this title if you, like myself, is a die-hard fan of survival horror, RE and PlayStation era games, otherwise, this is a very skippable title. And in fact, I only got to know and play this game because I was curious about \u0026ldquo;RE-clones\u0026rdquo;, and ended up finding this gem, was worth my time since it is a very short experience. A shame it has practically no replay value, which is an important thing on this genre in particular.\n","date":"5 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/trag-mission-of-mercy/","section":"Posts","summary":"A relatively obscure action-adventure game that attempted to combine tactical gameplay with a hostage-rescue narrative.","title":"T.R.A.G.: Mission of Mercy"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRhythmic Shooter Fusion #This title is an energetic and highly distinctive fusion of rhythm game mechanics with FPS action. At its core, the game requires the you to perform almost every action, firing, reloading, dashing, jumping, according to the beat of an intense, hard-hitting metal soundtrack. This creates a combat flow that feels almost like playing an instrument: battles become rhythmic patterns to perfect rather than simple firefights. When everything lines up, the game delivers a sense of synergy and momentum that few shooters achieve, making it feel genuinely fresh in a crowded genre.\nOverwhelming Mental Challenge #The experience this game delivers is not unique, but it is a rare one, in a sense of it making you feel like you are using more than 100% of your brain, almost making time standing still with how much focus you need in order to progress through certain challenges. I also said the same thing about some of the bosses in Silksong, but on the case of this particular title, I think it might be due to my limited experience with rhythmic games. Although I learned to play the guitar, and the electric guitar too, I still felt an immense challenge while playing this game, and I even performed some live shows myself. I guess my point is that, if you are looking for a challenge, then look no further, BPM will deliver it while making it feel like a punch in your face.\nRoguelike Variety Explained #The game adopts a roguelike structure, meaning each run presents different challenges, layouts, weapons and upgrades. This randomness helps keep the experience engaging, especially when the game introduces powerful ability combinations or unique weapon modifiers that significantly change how a run plays. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t like this kind of approach to any extent, I advise staying away from this game because it won\u0026rsquo;t win you over. Multiple playable Valkyrie characters add another layer of variety, with each offering a distinct twist on movement, health, or abilities. Though I got to admit that I mostly played with the first one available since it is the most balanced of them all, and I still had a blast, but you can safely spend a ton of extra time trying to master all of the other ones because they are so unique that it ends up being a love-or-hate situation.\nStyle, Atmosphere, Mastery #Because of this structure, BPM encourages experimentation and rewards players who gradually internalize patterns, enemy behaviors, and rhythmic timing. And since I mostly relied on using the most balanced character, I had to maximize this immensely because I had no substantial advantage. Visually, the game stands out with its bold, stylized aesthetic, frequently using a limited color palette that gives each world a strong identity. And as much as I loved the art-style, I had to lower the level of saturation through all the levels because it can make enemies hard to spot. Combined with the soundtrack, mostly composed of fast, metal-inspired tracks, the atmosphere is both intense and cohesive.\nMusic-Driven Intensity #The game feels like it was built around its music, which elevates even simple encounters into dramatic rhythm-driven set pieces. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough when I say this game has one of the best OSTs I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, and it is expected since this is a rhythm game after all. I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I\u0026rsquo;m a metal-head myself, but I can safely say this will please other audiences since it\u0026rsquo;s songs are not really very hardcore, and especially because they have no vocals, which can make-or-break when it comes to the Metal genre. One thing is certain, it\u0026rsquo;ll be one of those games that you have a playlist to listen to from time to time, or even to add to your \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; playlist, for example.\nSteep Rhythm Demands #However, BPM’s strengths can also be barriers. The requirement to act strictly on the beat may frustrate players who aren’t comfortable with rhythm-based gameplay. Missing even a couple of beats can interrupt combat flow or leave you vulnerable, and some weapons have timing windows that take patience to master. The difficulty curve is steep, especially in early hours, and runs can end abruptly due to small mistakes. Fortunately it has some nice accessibility features such as turning the rhythm mechanic completely off, or making it more loose when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s detection, and also four different difficulty levels. I advise trying to get the hang of it in the \u0026ldquo;Practice\u0026rdquo; difficulty level, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you are familiar with either shooters or rhythm games, trust me, this title will crush you to pieces.\nRepetition and Randomness #On top of that, while the procedural generation offers variety, it does not entirely mask the limited pool of enemy types and room variations, which can start to feel repetitive after prolonged play. By far the randomness is the number one factor that can help you with a successful run, I advise exploring as much as possible in the early-to-mid level maps, focusing on healing and life-steal items. Narrative elements are almost nonexistent, so if you are looking for story-driven motivations or world-building will find little beyond the thematic Norse-inspired backdrop. BPM is totally focused on gameplay mechanics, challenge and repetition, rather than lore or cinematic moments.\nA Bold Hybrid #Overall, this game is a bold and memorable experiment that succeeds best with people who enjoy mastering systems, learning patterns and embracing difficulty. Its blend of rhythm and shooting creates a rare feeling of being fully synchronized with the game’s world, even if that experience comes with a steep learning curve. For fans of rhythm games, fast-paced shooters, or challenging roguelikes, BPM offers something unique, stylish and rewarding. People seeking narrative depth, relaxed pacing or traditional FPS gameplay may find it less appealing, but those open to its hybrid identity will discover a fast, thrilling and highly replayable experience. This is one of the best games that I\u0026rsquo;ve played through each and every genre it is trying to convey, a must-play if you like any of them to any extent.\n","date":"1 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bpm-bullets-per-minute/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an energetic and highly distinctive fusion of rhythm game mechanics with FPS action.","title":"BPM Bullets Per Minute"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nInventive Kirby Anthology #This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library. Instead of presenting a single adventure, it offers a collection of smaller games that each explore different ideas, mechanics, and tones. This anthology approach keeps the experience constantly fresh, making even short modes feel meaningful because they contribute to a larger, varied whole. At first I thought this was a weird formula, but I ended up enjoying this very much, despite it being very exotic, making it feel like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be a mainline Kirby game in the first place. And this feeling is more related to other less polished games, which had lots of game modes to compensate for the lack of overall quality, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad to say this is not the case for this title.\nDynamic Copy Abilities #At the core of the game is Kirby’s copy ability, which has never felt more dynamic than it does here. Many abilities feature expanded move sets that borrow from fighting-game inputs, giving combat a surprising depth without sacrificing accessibility. The ability to create Helper characters from discarded powers introduces a cooperative element as well; when controlled by a second player, this system turns the game into a lively two-player experience that feels ahead of its time. Unfortunately I never experienced this, so I played the entire experience alone, and while I liked this mechanic, it really makes the game feel cluttered. Sometimes there is a lot going on on-screen that you get lost if you decide to engage with this mechanic, so I decided to very rarely use this.\nCharming SNES Presentation #The presentation is among the best on the SNES, with colorful visuals, expressive sprites, and smooth animations that bring the world to life. Each ability is carefully animated, and the environments feel vibrant and playful. This is no surprise for fans of this character since all of it\u0026rsquo;s games have the same very high level of quality and polish when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s minor details. Every character, especially Kirby, has a lot of animations and expressions, making them feel much more vivid, even though they are just 16-bit sprites moving around. The soundtrack is equally charming, packed with energetic themes that complement the game’s upbeat personality and have become iconic within the series.\nDistinct Game Modes #Each mode brings something unique: Spring Breeze acts as a gentle introduction, very traditional and I think it was my favorite. Dyna Blade offers light exploration and less focus on the combat. The Great Cave Offensive experiments with treasure hunting in a large interconnected environment, and you can definitely sink a lot of hours on this one if you want to 100% it, feels like a NG+ secret hunting. Revenge of Meta Knight introduces a fast-paced narrative with timed segments, and by far this was the most dynamic one, you even get a timer to each stage, similar to classic Mario titles. And Milky Way Wishes changes the rules by removing Kirby’s inhale ability and focusing on ability collection, and I admit that this was my least favorite one, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even finish this mode, I got frustrated trying to find the correct way to progress through the maps.\nTimeless Kirby Experience #My second least favorite is the racing one, too short, simple and easy, and while I like this aspect on most Kirby games, the racing mode simply never felt satisfying enough for me to try and get higher scores outside the minimum ones in order to progress further. Overall, this title remains one of the most inventive and polished platformers of its era. Its variety, strong mechanics, charming presentation, and cooperative gameplay give it exceptional replay value. Nearly three decades later, it still feels joyful, clever, and remarkably modern, it is definitely a must-play if you like Kirby to any extent. It is fairly short even, so there is very little reason not to try this, not to mention it got a lot of modes so you never get burn out of the gameplay loop.\n","date":"23 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kirby-super-star/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library.","title":"Kirby Super Star"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nVibrant Cultural Style #This title is a stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming into a uniquely charming package. Set in a cartoonish world inspired by Mexican folklore, the game immediately stands out with its bold color palette, expressive characters, and smooth animations. Everything, from the towns you visit to the supernatural landscapes you explore, feels handcrafted and full of personality, giving the adventure a lively and memorable identity. This is truly one of the most unique games when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s art-style, we sometimes take it for granted when we experience content inspired by other cultures. But this one is a big standout, not just because this is not a very well explored culture, but also when it comes to the overall quality and presentation, even when compared to more traditionally explored cultures such as the japanese/asian ones.\nDynamic Luchador Combat #Combat is both fast and satisfying, the MC is called Juan, a humble agave farmer turned luchador, and the moveset reflects that wrestling theme with hard-hitting throws, slams, and special attacks. The combo system encourages experimentation, letting you juggle enemies, switch targets mid-air, and weave in special abilities for extra power. As you progress, you unlock new moves that not only expand your offensive options but also serve as keys to explore previously inaccessible areas. This creates a rewarding loop of discovering upgrades, backtracking, and uncovering secrets that enrich the world. And despite it not being a hard game in general, it is still a very satisfying combat, with a lot of enemy variety and a balanced combo system, similar to even something like Devil May Cry or God of War.\nInventive Dimension Platforming #Platforming is another highlight, and the game uses its mechanics in inventive ways. One of the most distinctive features is the ability to switch between the “living” and “dead” dimensions, often in the middle of tricky jumps or enemy encounters. This mechanic keeps the platforming fresh and forces you to stay alert, especially in later stages where timing becomes crucial. It may not sound like a standout feature but, when you start playing while using this, you start to notice the game becomes much more complex overall, not just when it comes to the combat, but especially the platforming. Another standout to this mechanic is the fact that, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle, the development team had to recreate the entire game map due to the implementation of this mechanic, which is an incredible task. Puzzles are generally fair, with a good balance between reflex-based challenges and thoughtful navigation, they are as enjoyable as the combat or the platforming.\nPlayful Meta Humor #The humor throughout the game is lighthearted and self-aware, full of puns, visual jokes, and nods to video game culture. You can even notice some old memes from back in the day, immortalized on this piece of videogame, which is a nice nostalgia trip. NPCs frequently break the fourth wall, and the world is peppered with posters, signs, and side characters that add comedic flavor without feeling forced. It helps that the tone never takes itself too seriously; the story is simple but engaging, built around rescuing El Presidente’s daughter and defeating the skeletal villain Carlos Calaca. And since I live very close to Mexico I had a fond connection to this game\u0026rsquo;s culture because I experienced it in other places such as my childhood cartoons for example, I loved \u0026ldquo;¡Mucha Lucha!\u0026rdquo; as a kid.\nEnhanced Definitive Edition #This game improves on the original release by adding new areas, new enemy types, and additional difficulty options, making this version feel more complete and refined. It also supports local co-op, which turns the adventure into a fun, chaotic shared experience where teamwork actually enhances the platforming and combat. I played this with a friend for the first time, but we only reached half the game progress, then I decided to replay it from the beginning, alone, and almost 100% it. While the game still leans on repeated combat arenas and isn’t as long as some other Metroidvanias, its pacing remains brisk, and its mechanics stay entertaining from start to finish. I recommend trying to 100% this game, it has some amazing late-game content which enhances the experience. Since the overall journey is not really a hard one, the optional contents makes up for this with some platforming, combat and puzzle sections that are very challenging, even for veterans of the genre.\nA Timeless Metroidvania #Not to mention the classical secrets that makes up for the 100% factor, trying to find everything and do every side-quest feels like the intended way of experiencing this, similar to other titles of the same genre. Overall, this game is a polished, spirited, and highly enjoyable action-platformer. Its humor, art direction, and combat depth set it apart, while its clever level design and dimension-shifting mechanics keep the gameplay consistently engaging. Whether you’re a fan of Metroidvanias or just looking for a distinctive and energetic adventure, it remains one of the standout indie titles of its era. I consider this one of the best indie Metroidvanias that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, despite it\u0026rsquo;s age.\n","date":"21 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/guacamelee/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming.","title":"Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nEnhanced GBA Remake #This game was one of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld. At its core, it is a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2 (the version originally released in North America), but it isn’t just a simple port, it’s a significantly enhanced reimagining designed to feel fresh while still honoring the original. Visually, the game shines with bright, colorful sprites that make excellent use of the GBA’s hardware. Characters and enemies are more expressive, with smooth animations and added personality, like Mario’s exaggerated jump poses or Birdo’s lively attacks. The environments also feel richer and more detailed than on the NES, breathing new life into familiar levels.\nFaithful Yet Fresh Gameplay #I played the original back in the day but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the first few levels since it was too complex for me as a kid to understand, not to mention it works a bit differently than traditional Mario titles. The gameplay remains faithful to SMB2’s unique identity. You choose from Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, each with their distinct strengths, and progress through a mix of platforming and light puzzle-solving. The throwing mechanic, picking up enemies, vegetables, or objects, still gives the game a rhythm that sets it apart from traditional Mario titles. Controls are tighter than ever, and the GBA’s button layout makes the experience intuitive and responsive.\nRefined and Accessible #One of the most notable additions is the increased accessibility and refinement. The game offers more checkpoints, extra hearts, and improved enemy behavior, making it friendlier for newcomers without dumbing down the challenge. Your character has a number of hits it needs to take before dying, not just one or two like regular Mario, and you can also stack them if you play well enough. Whenever you actually die, you ca even switch characters on the fly, and play with the new one from the checkpoint forward. The newly added voice clips, sometimes amusing, sometimes repetitive, give the cast extra charm, even if they’re a bit campy. In my opinion this is the worst and best addition, by far, the voice-acting is so bad it is hilarious.\nWeak Soundtrack, Strong Package #As for the soundtrack, despite me being a fan of Nintendo on this regard, this game is by far one of the worst ones on this aspect. The OST is practically non-existent, it plays the same song over and over, on all levels, despite the character or boss that you are playing at the moment. Overall, this game is a warm, lively remake that successfully modernizes a classic while maintaining its quirky essence. Whether you’re revisiting SMB2 or discovering it for the first time, it remains a joyful and polished platformer that helped define the early GBA library. I recommend trying to 100% it since it is a fairly short play, it\u0026rsquo;ll help with this problem if you try to chase all secrets, not to mention playing as all the characters is also a fun addition, instead of focusing on just one.\n","date":"17 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-mario-advance/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld.","title":"Super Mario Advance"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nFPS/RPG Hybrid Roots #This title is a modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, and unlike most shooters of its time, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics, allowing you to interact with NPCs, engage in dialogue, and complete quest-like objectives. The game gives you a sense of choice in how they approach situations, whether through combat, negotiation, or exploration. The world of Strife is set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic industrial environment dominated by a sinister cult known as “The Order.” This narrative depth, combined with the your ability to affect outcomes through dialogue and quests, gives the game a more story-driven approach compared to many of its contemporaries, making it stand out in the mid-1990s shooter landscape.\nRevolutionary Remastered Return #And while it may not sound unique for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, this is fore sure one of the most revolutionary games of it\u0026rsquo;s time, there is nothing quite like this on this period of time in gaming. The Veteran Edition, released by Nightdive Studios (these folks are amazing), modernizes the original game to run on contemporary systems. It adds widescreen support, improved input options, and enhanced compatibility with modern operating systems, making it far easier to experience on current PCs, or PC Handhelds. The weapons, ranging from conventional firearms to more unique tools like the flamethrower or the mauler, offer you a variety of ways to approach combat encounters.\nChallenging Retro Exploration #I played it in the normal difficulty level and I still had a lot of challenge, especially because all the maps have a very high number of enemies, and they can quickly swarm you. The game’s design encourages exploration, and you are often rewarded for taking the time to search environments and talk to NPCs. For fans of retro gaming, these features help preserve the charm and identity of the original while making it accessible to modern audiences. Despite these improvements, Strife’s underlying engine, derived from the Doom engine lineage, shows its age. Level design can be confusing, with maze-like layouts that are sometimes difficult to navigate.\nAged Yet Charming Design #Enemy behavior is limited, and while the game offers multiple playstyles, many sections push you toward a more linear, combat-heavy approach. Some mechanics, such as stealth or negotiation, feel underdeveloped, and the interface can be clunky by modern standards. Visually, the game looks dated, and while the Veteran Edition smooths over technical issues, it cannot fully modernize the aesthetics of a mid-1990s game. Though for me personally I really like this aesthetic, so I cannot count this aspect of the game as a complete downside, there are quite good-looking titles nowadays which uses this art-style such as Ion Fury, for example.\nEnduring Retro Appeal #Overall, this game is a compelling experience for people interested in retro shooters or the history of FPS/RPG hybrids. It is not a polished, modern game, but it succeeds in preserving the spirit and atmosphere of the original. Its combination of narrative depth, exploration, and combat provides a nostalgic yet engaging experience, particularly for those willing to approach it with patience and a retro gaming mindset. For fans of classic games or those curious about the evolution of story-driven shooters, this one definitely remains a noteworthy and enjoyable title.\n","date":"13 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/strife-veteran-edition/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics.","title":"Strife Veteran Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Sci-Fi Mystery #This title is one of the most ambitious cinematic platformers of its era, a game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences. The MC is called Conrad B. Hart, a young agent who wakes up on an alien planet with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As the mystery unfolds, you piece together his identity and uncover a plot involving alien infiltration and political conspiracy. As much as the videogame industry is immensely saturated with amnesia tropes, this is without a doubt, one of the most unique experiences when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s narrative.\nRotoscoped Visual Mastery #On the SNES, Flashback retains the game\u0026rsquo;s signature rotoscoped animation, which was groundbreaking at the time. The team behind this displayed a great deal of evolution when it comes to their previous delivery, which was Out of This World (or, Another World), which both use the exact same art-style and animations. Every movement, from running and climbing to drawing your gun, is smooth and realistic, lending the game a unique cinematic quality. The environments are richly detailed, with futuristic cities, jungles, and alien landscapes that create a strong sense of atmosphere, even within the system’s limited color palette.\nDeliberate Platforming Challenge #As for the gameplay, it blends platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Unlike typical action games of the early ’90s, it rewards patience and observation over reflexes. Movement is deliberate and grid-based, meaning timing and precision are essential for climbing ledges, dodging traps, and engaging enemies. I advise an insane amount of patience when playing this, not only because of how old this game is, but even for the standards at the time, it\u0026rsquo;s implementation and genre makes it so that you get frustrated for trying to perform the utmost basic actions.\nTense Minimalist Combat #The combat is simple but tense, with your energy shield and pistol serving as your lifeline in a hostile world. There is but only a single weapon, with infinite ammo, and while this may sound appealing, you cannot go guns blazing. The shield can be recharged on certain areas, which is somewhat like a checkpoint for a quick breather, enabling you to be hit at least five times before the game-over screen. And lastly, later on in the game you\u0026rsquo;ll find an item that can stop enemy projectiles, making the combat a bit more dynamic from that point onward.\nAtmospheric Narrative World #Between the action, you’ll interact with NPCs, use items, and navigate dialogue sequences that feel more akin to an adventure game than a standard platformer. The story-telling is a highlight, told through cinematic cutscenes, mysterious journals, and Conrad’s own discoveries. It captures the tone of classic sci-fi films like Blade Runner and Total Recall, mixing cyberpunk aesthetics with philosophical undertones about identity and humanity. The music and sound design reinforce this mood, with atmospheric effects and a hauntingly minimalist soundtrack. This is one of the titles that helped define the \u0026ldquo;retro\u0026rdquo; landscape when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic. It is something that will stick to the back of your mind when you listen to things like Synthwave for example.\nTimeless but Demanding #That said, this is absolutely not an easy game, the controls can feel stiff and unforgiving to modern players, and trial-and-error is often required to progress. Still, mastering its rhythm is part of the appeal, it’s a product of an era when games expected you to learn through failure and persistence. Overall, this game remains a landmark in cinematic storytelling and animation in video games. Its combination of atmospheric design, thoughtful pacing, and sci-fi intrigue makes it a timeless experience, even if its dated controls and difficulty may deter newcomers. For fans of classic adventures and 16-bit experimentation, it’s a must-play piece of gaming history.\n","date":"9 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/flashback/","section":"Posts","summary":"A game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences.","title":"Flashback The Quest for Identity"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBittersweet Final Evolution #The 4th entry to the Mega Man Zero franchise marks the grand finale of the series, and it delivers one of the most refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA. This installment feels like both a mechanical evolution and a narrative closure. A game that understands exactly what made its predecessors great while ensuring Zero’s story ends on a powerful, bittersweet note. Even though it is quite a short title, it still tries to deliver a complete experience, not denying it is a handheld title, while at the same time taking itself serious enough for what it is trying to achieve.\nHope Amid Despair #Set after the events of Zero 3, the game finds Zero and Ciel’s resistance helping a group of human refugees escape Neo Arcadia’s oppressive rule to find peace on the surface. The plot carries a strong undercurrent of hope and despair, themes of sacrifice, humanity, and perseverance are woven throughout the dialogue and atmosphere. The story’s tone is more reflective, almost elegiac, as if the series itself knows the end is near. And this is a big shift compared to the previous entries, which focused more on characters than on the world and the plot behind it, more similar to the mainline entries of the Mega Man X series.\nRefined Combat Additions #As for the gameplay, it polishes the series’ trademark mix of fast-paced combat, precision platforming, and tactical customization. The standout addition is the Z-Knuckle, a versatile new tool that lets Zero steal and use enemy weapons, from guns and hammers to shields, adding a refreshing layer of variety and strategy. But I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t interesting enough for me to want to engage with it, so I barely even used it. I wish this new mechanic was more focused on the exploration aspect instead of the combat, it would make it more interesting. The weather system is another clever addition, each stage has two weather conditions that alter enemy behavior and hazards.\nChallenge and Rewards #And choosing the “harder” weather grants additional rewards, catering to people who crave challenge and replayability. Unfortunately I noticed this very late into the game, so I rarely managed to get the somewhat secret/extra optional abilities you get, and they are very well worth it, I recommend trying to unlock all of them. Difficulty, historically punishing in the series, is better balanced here, and I dare to say this is too easy sometimes. The new Cyber-Elf system consolidates previous games’ complex upgrade mechanics into a single, easier-to-manage entity, streamlining progression without oversimplifying it. Thought at the same time, it is quite toned down compared to the previous Z entries.\nTight Design Brilliance #Levels are tightly designed, emphasizing skillful movement and pattern recognition, while boss fights remain intense showcases of reflex and mastery. I really enjoyed that each ad every level has one sub-boss for you to fight, even the late-stage levels, this makes all this much more interesting when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s pacing. Visually, the game continues to push the GBA’s hardware to its limits with expressive sprite work, detailed environments, and smooth animations. Each stage bursts with color and mechanical detail, maintaining the gritty, post-apocalyptic tone that defines the series. The OST is equally memorable, as always, similar to the mainline X series, but with a more melancholic tone since this is what this series forever tried to convey.\nA Worthy Finale #This is most definitely a must-play if you like the Mega Man series to any extent, I recommend going for the re-releases for modern platforms since you can easily get a bundle with all the titles. But since I\u0026rsquo;m a try-hard, I played the original version instead, which is still enjoyable enough. And lastly, I feel that this title is the weakest of all of the Z franchise, similar to how I rank Mega Man X6, which is also a good fit to end the saga, but at the same time, you know it had way less attention than it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors.\n","date":"7 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-zero-4/","section":"Posts","summary":"This marks the grand finale of the series, a refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA.","title":"Mega Man Zero 4"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 95 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Sequel Reimagined #This title, by Team Cherry, is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight. After years of speculation, delays, and fervent community anticipation, Silksong emerges not just as a continuation of Hollow Knight’s legacy but as a reimagining of what a sequel can be. It carries forward the spirit of discovery, challenge, and melancholy beauty that defined the original while reshaping the formula around its new protagonist, one of the bosses in the first title, Hornet. This time around the location of the world is called Pharloom, so we are no longer in Hallownest. It inverts the descent into darkness of the first game, challenging you to ascend through layered environments, each brimming with its own mysteries, dangers, and emotional weight.\nHornet’s Agile Gameplay #From the first moment you take control of Hornet, it’s clear that this sequel moves to a different rhythm. Where the Knight of the first game felt methodical and grounded, Hornet is quick, acrobatic, and expressive. Her needle and thread weapon serve as both a tool for combat and traversal, allowing her to dash across gaps, pull herself toward enemies, and weave through combat scenarios with a balletic grace. I had two feelings regarding the first few mechanic introductions, one is the pogo, the initial downward strike is very hard to master, and second, that the very welcoming addition of edge grabbing. The controls are tight and responsive, rewarding precision and timing in a way that feels immediately satisfying, and this shift in movement philosophy changes the entire tone of the game.\nPharloom’s Vertical Beauty #The new Pharloom region feels both alien and familiar, echoing the quiet sadness of Hallownest while introducing a fresh aesthetic variety. The environments are more vertical, emphasizing Hornet’s agility and this makes you think more multi-dimensionally. Each biome, tells its own story through architecture and ambient detail, which is an inheritance of games such as Dark Souls. Every corner hides a secret, and every vista carries the haunting beauty that has become Team Cherry’s signature art-style. The game’s visual presentation remains hand-drawn, filled with fluid animations and a painterly sense of color and light that makes each area distinct and memorable. And similar to the first title, it heavily relies in the use of the parallax effect in order to create a sense of immersion.\nA Haunting Soundscape #This game OST, once again, plays a central role in defining its emotional landscape. Somber strings and delicate piano melodies evoke a sense of longing and loss, while tense, rhythmic compositions drive the intensity of boss encounters. The soundtrack shifts dynamically as you explore, adding layers of atmosphere that deepen the sense of immersion. So no big changes from the first entry, it retains the exact same style and level of quality. It’s not merely background music, it feels like an emotional partner to the journey, guiding you through her trials and triumphs. And again, similar to the first title, it\u0026rsquo;s OST it\u0026rsquo;ll also be on my of playlists, alongside others such as Deltarune, Undertale and the Mega Man series. The boss themes are also amazing, especially ones like Karmelita and Lace. Unfortunately, the Hornet\u0026rsquo;s theme is dedicated to the first game, so we never get to hear it on this entry, though I think that it is what the bosses hear whenever we start a fight with them.\nRefined Core Systems #As for the gameplay, it strikes a delicate balance between evolution and tradition. Many of the core systems from Hollow Knight return, exploration, platforming, and combat remain tightly interwoven, but they’ve been refined to suit Hornet’s more energetic playstyle. Healing now requires the use of silk rather than soul, adding a new dimension of risk and reward. And I think that the healing mechanic now is much more fun since it gives you more options, such as doing it while in movement. Crafting replaces charms, letting you forge tools and upgrades that better suit their preferred approach. The result is a system that feels more customizable and experimental. There’s a greater variety of weapons, movement abilities, and environmental puzzles, ensuring that every new zone introduces something mechanically fresh.\nExpanded World Scale #I noticed a lot of people disliking the more limited approach (more balanced, really) to this system, but I think it served this game better since Hornet is more capable than the Knight, already being powerful without any upgrades. One of its most noticeable improvements lies in its sense of scale, Pharloom is significantly larger than Hallownest, with more interconnected pathways, secret areas, and optional challenges. And at the same time, Hollownest was already immense, so be prepared for at least double the amount of exploration. The game world feels alive with characters, many of whom have their own side quests, stories, and moral complexities. These interactions add depth to the narrative without sacrificing the trademark ambiguity that made the original so captivating.\nDifficulty and Mastery #The writing is subtle but emotionally resonant, you feel the weight of the world’s history in every ruined chapel, forgotten grave, and whispered line of dialogue. Even though it follows the game\u0026rsquo;s unique spoken language, you still feel and understand the emotions of the characters since the voice-acting is phenomenal. Despite these strengths, Silksong is not without its frustrations. Its difficulty curve is steep, being even harder than the first title, which is already very hard in the first place. Boss battles, while exhilarating and expertly designed, often require dozens of attempts to master. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough when I say that your brain will be used to it\u0026rsquo;s maximum level when you engage in the boss fights, some of them are so hard that it feels like time has stopped. Enemy attacks are faster and more aggressive, demanding sharper reflexes and deeper understanding of movement mechanics. Not to mention that you now receive twice as much damage, from the very beginning of the game, making you an even more glass cannon character than the Knight.\nPunishing Yet Rewarding #The game also inherits the punishing “run-back” system from its predecessor, dying can mean long treks back to your shade and another attempt at survival. And while I sometimes agree that this is a drawback since other similar games are no longer doing this, such as Elden Ring itself, some may even consider this a QOL improvement. A this can be a satisfying test of skill, for others, it may verge on exhausting. I only really had any trouble with this on one particular boss called Groal The Great, otherwise, all the other ones are very tolerable. Still, when you finally conquer a brutal boss or uncover a hidden area, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.\nEpic Personal Journey #As for the narrative, it feels both intimate and epic, Hornet’s story is one of resilience and self-discovery, told not through heavy exposition but through the quiet spaces between action. And while the first game already set very high standards, and hyped up her backstory, in my opinion, it still managed blow away all my expectations. Her journey up through Pharloom mirrors you own growth as a player, from disoriented captive to agile master of her environment. Themes of rebirth, sacrifice, and legacy resonate throughout the experience, connecting Silksong to its predecessor while carving out a unique emotional identity. By the time the credits roll, it feels less like a sequel and more like a spiritual ascension of everything Hollow Knight represented. While at the same time (some spoilers now), the very first time you face the credits is just half the journey, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle.\nA Metroidvania Triumph #It is absolutely a must to 100% this game, I admit that I didn\u0026rsquo;t played the Steel Soul mode, but I at least performed 100% of the game\u0026rsquo;s contents like challenges, side-quests and optional bosses. Ultimately, this game justifies every minute of its long development cycle, it is a masterclass in game design, a seamless blend of art, challenge, and storytelling that captures the soul of the Metroidvania genre while expanding its boundaries. It’s more demanding than ever, but also more rewarding. It invites you to lose themselves in its intricate world, to learn through failure, and to find meaning in perseverance. For newcomers, it offers a beautiful yet brutal introduction to one of gaming’s most artful universes. For veterans, it’s the culmination of everything they loved about Hollow Knight, faster, sharper, and richer in every sense.\nA Defining Masterpiece #Hollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the defining games of 2025, a title that will be discussed, analyzed, and revered for years to come. It may not be flawless, but its imperfections only underline its ambition and humanity. Few games so confidently balance elegance and difficulty, serenity and chaos, despair and triumph. Team Cherry has once again created something timeless. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of all time, an a must-play if you like games to any extent, similar to the first entry. Not to mention it is easy to get your hands on it since the team decided to use regional prices, yet again setting new standards, not just to the game quality and it\u0026rsquo;s indie scope, but also when it comes to how it\u0026rsquo;s audience is treated.\nAn Unforgettable Experience #I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this enough, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be better experienced if you play the first game before going to this one. And trust me, half an hour playing the first Hollow Knight will be enough to get you hooked and you won\u0026rsquo;t notice that, out of nowhere, you played more than 20 hours and there is still a lot to see in the game. For my gameplay session I took two entire months, playing it to it\u0026rsquo;s entirety, doing 100% of the content (minus Steel Soul Mode) and I took 110 hours, more than double the amount of the first game. I can\u0026rsquo;t praise this game enough, I consider this to be the most advanced of indie titles, this is the most polished and has the highest level of quality we got up until this point in time. And despite it having a target audience and it\u0026rsquo;s own genre, I still recommend this if you are not familiar with Metroidvanias, just expect an insane level of challenge if you haven\u0026rsquo;t even touched the previous game.\n","date":"5 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hollow-knight-silksong/","section":"Posts","summary":"The long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight.","title":"Hollow Knight Silksong"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nUndead Revenge Unleashed #This title is a remaster of the 1997 cult-classic shooter Blood, by Nightdive Studios. It updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions, widescreen support, smoother performance, and improved compatibility with current hardware, while keeping its signature fast-paced and gory gameplay intact. The MC is called Caleb, an undead gunslinger out for revenge, battling cultists, zombies, and grotesque monsters across a series of cleverly designed levels filled with secrets and dark humor.\nFaithful Blood Restoration #The game’s biggest strength lies in how faithfully it preserves the spirit of the original. Weapons like the flare gun, dynamite bundles, and the voodoo doll remain just as satisfying to use, and the level design still stands out as some of the best from the Build engine era. The atmosphere, blending horror, comedy, and chaotic action, holds up very well. It also bundles in the two official expansions, Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, offering plenty of content for both newcomers and returning fans.\nA Brutal Revival #I highly recommend playing these extra content, they are well worth it, despite the main game being somewhat longer than it needs to be, so maybe come back later to finish it another opportunity. However, not everything is perfect, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice slight differences in movement, weapon behavior, and difficulty balance compared to the original version, making it feel “off” in subtle ways. Overall, this game is a successful revival of one of the best shooters of the 90s. It’s brutal, stylish, and has a lot of replay value, combining old-school charm with modern accessibility.\nBoomer Shooter Masterclass #This shooter is truly one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind, it\u0026rsquo;s originality alone carry the game forward, even if you are not a fan of shooters. Despite it being considered a boomer shooter cult-classic nowadays, it has a varied way of playing it with the amount of different weapons you can play around with. Not to mention it\u0026rsquo;s enemies and level design force you to be creative and use all of them in order to maximize your chance if not dying, because trust me, it\u0026rsquo;ll happen a lot. For fans of retro FPS games, this is definitely a must-play, just expect a tough, unforgiving experience that stays true to its roots.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/blood-fresh-supply/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remaster of the 1997 title, by Nightdive Studios, it updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions.","title":"Blood Fresh Supply"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHand-Painted Metroidvania Charm #This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences. The game immediately stands out with its hand-painted backgrounds, fluid character animations, and richly detailed environments, which give it a distinctive, almost storybook-like aesthetic. Every area feels vibrant and alive, from lush forests to eerie caves, and the attention to visual detail demonstrates the dedication from the development team. The OST complements the visuals beautifully, offering melodic themes that enhance both exploration and combat, creating a captivating atmosphere throughout the journey.\nFluid, Accessible Combat #As for the combat, it is responsive and satisfying, featuring a combination of melee attacks, magic, and the assistance of Fidget, a small, flying companion who adds an extra layer of strategy. Early encounters feel engaging, and the progression system allows you to unlock new abilities and upgrades, giving the gameplay a sense of growth. The game is also accessible, with controls that feel intuitive, making it easy for newcomers to dive in without feeling overwhelmed. The pacing is generally well-balanced, alternating between exploration, platforming, and combat encounters to keep the experience fresh.\nMystery-Filled Hero’s Journey #The narrative follows Dust, a mysterious warrior on a journey to uncover his past, accompanied by Fidget and other colorful characters. While the story provides enough context to drive the adventure, some may find the writing and voice acting uneven. Though in my opinion, this is an acceptable level of quality due to the fact that this title was developed by a single person. Dialogue can occasionally feel forced or simplistic, and certain plot points are predictable, but the character designs and world-building help maintain engagement. Side quests and hidden areas encourage exploration. I encourage this game to be played 100% since it isn\u0026rsquo;t very long and there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of side-quests, so each and every single one of them is a significant and worthwhile experience.\nImpressive Solo-Dev Achievement #For an indie game developed primarily by one person, the ambition, polish, and charm are remarkable, making it a standout in its genre. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted, engaging action-platformer that combines fluid combat, gorgeous visuals, and a charming world. While it may not challenge hardcore people with deep mechanics or complex level design, it offers a highly enjoyable experience for fans of 2D adventure games and indie titles. Its accessibility, style, and polished presentation make it a memorable journey that is well worth experiencing.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/dust-an-elysian-tail/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences.","title":"Dust An Elysian Tail"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nGex Goes 3D #This title is a 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody, and the era’s fascination with mascot adventures. It’s the second entry in the Gex series and marks the character’s leap from his 2D origins on the 3DO into a fully 3D world, following in the footsteps of titles like Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot.\nChannel-Hopping Adventure #The MC is called Gex, a sarcastic, television-obsessed gecko recruited by a secret agency to once again stop his nemesis, Rez. The game’s levels are designed around TV “channels,” which serve as themed worlds parodying various genres, from cartoons and horror to sci-fi and spy movies. This framing gives the game a playful sense of variety and self-awareness that stands out even today.\nCollectibles and Chaos #Each world is filled with collectibles, hidden power-ups, and plenty of slapstick humor. Gex’s moveset, including tail whips, tongue grabs, and wall climbs, gives the you solid control, though the camera can sometimes make platforming frustrating. Still, for its time, the controls were ambitious and contributed to the game’s open-ended exploration style.\nToo Many One-Liners #The biggest draw is Gex himself, voiced by comedian Dana Gould, Gex constantly cracks jokes, references pop culture, and mocks TV clichés. Depending on your tolerance, his one-liners can be either charmingly nostalgic or grating after a while, but they undeniably give the game personality. Personally I got annoyed quite fast because the frequency that this happens is very high, taking me out of the focus of the gameplay.\nMascot of an Era #And while this title hasn’t aged as gracefully as some of other Gex entries, it remains a fun, distinctive snapshot of the PlayStation era. With imaginative level design, sharp humor, and a memorable mascot at its center, it’s a game that feels both dated and delightfully emblematic of the time when every studio wanted its own wisecracking animal hero. I would only recommend this one if you are a fan of Gex, or mascot games in general.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gex-enter-the-gecko/","section":"Posts","summary":"A 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody.","title":"Gex Enter the Gecko"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nWhimsical Gothic Adventure #This MediEvil sequel is a delightful and whimsical action-adventure game that successfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. You once again play as Sir Daniel Fortesque, the skeletal hero with a heart of gold, in a quest that blends humor, gothic charm, and lighthearted adventure. The game’s setting, a richly imagined, slightly spooky version of Victorian England, is filled with cleverly designed levels that balance platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. Each area is bursting with personality, from eerie graveyards to bustling towns, and populated by a variety of quirky and memorable enemies.\nStylized Charm and Combat #One of the game’s strongest points is its visual design. The characters and environments are highly stylized, combining gothic horror elements with a playful cartoonish quality that makes the game approachable and endlessly charming. The OST complements this aesthetic perfectly, featuring catchy, atmospheric tunes that enhance both the humor and tension of the adventure. The combat is more refined than in the first game, with a mix of melee weapons and ranged options that keep encounters fresh, though some camera angles and movement controls occasionally feel awkward by today’s standards. I found myself using the extra combat mechanics way more than the first entry, which I mostly relied in using the regular sword slashes.\nChallenge, Secrets, Rewards #As for the complaints, there are a few boss fights, particularly the one against the Iron Slugger, which is ridiculously hard, to the point that there is but a single way of beating him. Exploration and discovery are heavily rewarded. Secret areas, hidden items, and collectible relics encourage you to thoroughly explore every nook and cranny, adding depth to the experience. The game also does a great job of balancing challenge with accessibility, making it enjoyable for both newcomers and fans of the original.

Set once again in a dark, demon-infested version of feudal Japan, the MC this time is called Jubei Yagyu, a wandering samurai seeking revenge after his village is destroyed by the forces of the demonic warlord Nobunaga Oda. From the opening cinematic, it sets an intense tone, combining historical fiction with supernatural horror and stylized action in a way that feels distinctly cinematic for its time.\nCombat, Choice, Consequence #Gameplay revolves around tight sword-based combat and puzzle-solving in richly detailed pre-rendered environments. The combat system is simple but satisfying, timing parries and using elemental weapons against demons feels fluid and rewarding. Jubei can also absorb the souls of fallen enemies to upgrade weapons and items, a system that gives a light RPG flavor to the otherwise linear progression. One of the major additions in this sequel is the ally system, throughout the story, Jubei can interact with several supporting characters, and his choices, gifts, dialogue, and actions, influence who will join him and how the story unfolds. This feature adds replayability and emotional depth rarely seen in early 2000s action titles.\nAtmospheric Feudal Horror #Visually, the game is stunning for its era, with gorgeously designed backdrops, expressive character models, and cinematic cutscenes that still hold up in terms of atmosphere. The haunting OST and high-quality voice acting enhance the game’s dramatic tone. While this game retains the fixed camera angles and tank-style movement of survival horror titles like Resident Evil, these elements can feel dated or clunky by modern standards. However, they also contribute to the game’s tension and visual storytelling, framing scenes like moments from a film.\nAmbitious, Resonant Continuation #Overall, this sequel is a worthy continuation of the series, deeper, more ambitious, and more emotionally resonant than its predecessor. It’s a blend of action, atmosphere, and mythic storytelling, and it remains a must-play for fans of samurai epics and classic PS2-era action games. I tried to finish this in the original hardware back in the day, but bad resource management and hard boss fights prevented me from doing so, not to mention I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understood the ally system, which can make or break your playthrough.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/onimusha-2-samurai-destiny/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remarkable sequel that successfully expands on the foundation laid by the original entry.","title":"Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nExistence Beneath the Waves #This title is a deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread. Set in the decaying underwater facility PATHOS-II, the game thrusts you into a haunting narrative about identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human. The MC is called Simon Jarrett, an ordinary man who, after a brain scan in 2015, wakes up decades later in a mysterious research station at the bottom of the ocean. As he explores the flooded corridors and abandoned laboratories, Simon uncovers disturbing truths about humanity’s extinction and the desperate attempts of the station’s AI and its former inhabitants to preserve consciousness through technology.\nHorror Through Philosophy #The narrative is gripping, unfolding through environmental storytelling, computer logs, and tense dialogue that gradually reveals a terrifying yet thought-provoking picture of the world. Unlike most horror games, it doesn’t rely on jump scares or gore. Instead, its horror comes from philosophical unease, the blurred boundaries between humans and machines, the loss of self, and the nature of existence without physical form. It’s a game that makes you question your own identity and morality as you make difficult choices with no clear right answers. Despite all this, the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have any moral or decision making mechanics, which is unfortunate since it could improve it\u0026rsquo;s replay value.\nOppression in the Deep #Visually, it captures the oppressive isolation of the ocean floor perfectly. The lighting and sound design work hand-in-hand to build an atmosphere of suffocating tension. You can hear the creak of metal under pressure, the distant hum of machinery, and the distorted cries of something that used to be human. The art direction is superb, combining gritty industrial realism with eerie sci-fi surrealism. The gameplay is mostly exploratory, interspersed with stealth sections where you must avoid hostile creatures. These segments are among the game’s weaker points, you may find them frustrating or at odds with the otherwise slow, meditative pace. Fortunately, the later-added Safe Mode allows you to experience the story without worrying about being attacked, making it ideal for those more interested in the narrative than the horror mechanics.\nTranscendence and Identity #What makes this title stand out the most is its emotional and intellectual resonance. It’s less about surviving monsters and more about confronting what happens when humanity transcends, its own physicality. By the time the credits roll, most people are left reflecting on questions that linger long after the screen goes dark. In short, this game is a masterful fusion of science fiction and psychological horror. It’s a slow, heavy, and deeply affecting experience that rewards patience and introspection. If you value atmosphere, storytelling, and existential themes over action, this is a game that will stay with you.\nA Heavy, Masterful Journey #This game is not for everyone, it is one of the heaviest titles that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and if you are not a fan of this kind of game than I would stay away from this one. I would also recommend not playing this is you have a hard time with horror experiences, because despite me considering myself almost bullet-proof when it comes to these games, I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a walk in the park. Ultimately, this is truly one of the best games of it\u0026rsquo;s genre, it showed how the Amnesia team evolved in absolutely every way possible, especially when it comes to story-telling and writing, I consider this a must-play not just if you like horror titles, but also if you like thought provoking stories.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/soma/","section":"Posts","summary":"A deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread.","title":"SOMA"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nReimagined Belmont Quest #This title is an action-platformer by Konami, serving as a loose remake of the PC Engine classic Rondo of Blood. While it shares the same protagonist, Richter Belmont, and a similar story, his quest to rescue his beloved Annette and defeat Count Dracula, it reimagines the original with new level layouts, different bosses, and a noticeably harsher difficulty curve. I admit that I never had the opportunity to play the PC Engine version, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say much on this regard.\nGothic Visual Brilliance #Visually, the game makes strong use of the SNES hardware, featuring rich, gothic environments, detailed sprites, and atmospheric backgrounds that give it a distinct identity from earlier entries. The OST, a highlight of nearly every Castlevania title, is a standout here as well. It delivers hauntingly energetic renditions of classic series themes and new compositions that fit perfectly with the dark, medieval tone. This was my very first Castlevania title, and still today, for me, this franchise\u0026rsquo;s OST is what gets my attention the most.\nClassic Castlevania Gameplay #And despite it being but only one of it\u0026rsquo;s high quality elements through, not just the mainline entries, but also the spin-offs, I simpyl can\u0026rsquo;t praise this enough. As for the gameplay, this entry sticks closely to the traditional Castlevania formula, with methodical platforming, whip combat, and careful resource management of sub-weapons. Levels are linear, platforming is punishing, and enemy placement can feel downright brutal.\nChallenging Gothic Adventure #Still, for those who appreciate challenging old-school design, this game offers a satisfying, demanding adventure. It may not reach the same heights as the best entries in the franchise, but it captures the spirit of Castlevania with its gothic charm, memorable music, and relentless challenge. A must-play in my books when it comes to this franchise, even if imperfect, entry in the Belmont saga.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/castlevania-dracula-x/","section":"Posts","summary":"An action-platformer by Konami, serving as a loose remake of the PC Engine classic Rondo of Blood.","title":"Castlevania Dracula X"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nRevolutionary FPS Debut #The very first entry to the Crysis franchise is a FPS by Crytek that became instantly famous for its groundbreaking graphics and ambitious design. Set on a lush, tropical island, the MC is called Nomad, a U.S. Delta Force operative, who is tasked with rescuing hostages and investigating alien activity. What makes the experience truly unique is the Nanosuit, a high-tech exoskeleton that grants abilities such as enhanced strength, speed, armor, and even cloaking.\nTactical Gameplay Freedom #This allows for a variety of approaches, you can go in guns blazing, sneak past enemies unseen, or use environmental objects as weapons, giving unprecedented tactical freedom at the time. The open-ended level design encourages experimentation and rewards creativity. Combat feels dynamic because enemies react intelligently, cover is realistic, and the environment is highly interactive, allowing for destructible structures and natural cover. And this was impressive at the time, though still today, few games try to implement such deep and intelligent interactions with your enemies, so I can safely say this title is not all about the looks.\nGraphics and Story #But beyond the gameplay, it stunned you with its graphics, with detailed foliage, realistic lighting, and water effects that were unmatched in 2007, earning it a reputation as a benchmark for PC hardware. The story, involving a mix of North Korean soldiers and extraterrestrial invaders, is serviceable but mostly serves as a backdrop for the action rather than a deeply emotional narrative. And I wished that at least the characters that you interact with would be able to carry the plot, but very few of them are charismatic enough.\nPacing and Performance #Particularly, I really like the protagonists of the subsequent entries to the series, way more than the first one, such as Psycho and Prophet. Despite this, the pacing keeps you engaged from the dense jungle ambushes to large-scale confrontations with alien forces. As for the performance, this was notorious for being extremely demanding, to the point where the phrase “Can it run Crysis?” became a meme. Yet, for those with high-end PCs, the game offered a stunningly immersive experience that combined beauty, challenge, and innovation. Though as technology evolved, it became clear that the real issue in running this title was due to it\u0026rsquo;s bad optimization, which lead to poor resource usage when it comes to multi-core processors at the time.\nEnduring PC Milestone #In retrospect, this videogame remains a milestone in PC gaming, both as a showcase of technological achievement and as a flexible, thrilling shooter that rewards creativity and tactical thinking. I would recommend playing the Warhead expansion instead of this one, it is a much better experience in my opinion, and I would only advise playing the first entry if you are a fan of shooters in general and want to experience the past of FPS PC gaming\u0026rsquo;s milestones.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/crysis/","section":"Posts","summary":"First entry to the Crysis franchise, a FPS that became instantly famous for its groundbreaking graphics and ambitious design.","title":"Crysis"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 22 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nIsometric Reinvention Begins #This title represents a bold step for the long-running Darksiders franchise, shifting away from the traditional third-person action-adventure formula and embracing an isometric, top-down perspective reminiscent of Diablo or Torchlight. This prequel to the original Darksiders manages to capture the series signature mix of hack-and-slash combat, puzzle-solving, and heavy metal-inspired world design while adapting it to a new gameplay style. The game follows the horsemen War and Strife, with the latter making his playable debut. War, known for his brute strength and swordplay, contrasts perfectly with Strife’s agility and dual-pistol combat.\nDual Horsemen Dynamics #Particularly speaking I paid zero attention to War on this game, despite it being an amazing character, simply because Strife is way more fun to play around with, and works better for this kind of gameplay. You can freely switch between the two characters in single-player mode or team up with a friend in two-player co-op, either locally or online. This dynamic creates a satisfying blend of playstyles: War’s close-range power suits crowd control and boss fights, while Strife’s ranged attacks provide precision and mobility. The combat system, while streamlined compared to previous entries, remains fluid, fast, and immensely enjoyable, offering a great rhythm of melee combos, dodging, and ability use.\nStylized Apocalyptic Aesthetic #Visually, it maintains the series trademark comic book-inspired art direction, with bold lines, exaggerated proportions, and apocalyptic landscapes teeming with demonic enemies. Each level offers a mixture of combat arenas, hidden paths, and environmental puzzles that reward exploration. The music and sound design complement the tone perfectly, blending orchestral and heavy guitar tracks that intensify major battles and boss encounters.\nPrequel Hunt for Lucifer #The game’s story takes place before the events of the first Darksiders, exploring the early days of the Horsemen’s service to the Charred Council. It follows War and Strife as they hunt down a demon prince named Lucifer, who is plotting to upset the balance between Heaven and Hell. While the plot isn’t groundbreaking, it provides enough intrigue and personality to sustain the adventure. The banter between the two protagonists is a highlight, Strife’s witty, sarcastic humor plays well off War’s stoic seriousness, giving the duo a fun “buddy cop” dynamic that keeps cutscenes entertaining.\nFlaws Amid Stylish Chaos #Despite its strengths, this game isn’t without flaws, the isometric viewpoint can occasionally make combat or navigation feel imprecise, especially during sections requiring platforming or tight jumps. The story, while entertaining, leans more on humor and action than emotional weight or character development. Some people may also find the loot and customization systems lighter than expected, especially if they’re coming from loot-driven action RPGs. Still, these shortcomings are balanced by the game’s brisk pacing, satisfying combat, and creative level design.\nA Fresh Darksiders Vision #Ultimately, this game succeeds in delivering a compact but stylish reimagining of the franchise. It may not match the grand scale or narrative ambition of its predecessors, but its focus on fun, fast-paced gameplay and cooperative action makes it a standout entry in its own right. It’s a testament to the flexibility of the Darksiders universe that such a different approach can still feel authentic to its roots. Whether you’re a long-time fan or a newcomer looking for a well-crafted action game, it is still an easy recommendation since it has a ton of replay value.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/darksiders-genesis/","section":"Posts","summary":"A bold step for the long-running Darksiders franchise, shifting away from the traditional third-person formula.","title":"Darksiders Genesis"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nVillainous Hero Origins #This title is a dark fantasy action-platformer developed and published by Capcom, serving as the third entry in the Gargoyle’s Quest series, which spun off from Ghosts ’n Goblins. Released late in the SNES lifespan, it didn’t receive much commercial attention at the time, but it has since become a cult classic, and for good reason. The MC is called Firebrand, the red demon who was once a recurring boss in Ghosts ’n Goblins. Particularly speaking I was not a fan of games in which you play as the villain at first, but I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love this approach to story-telling, it deepens the lore, universe and the backstory behind the events of previous titles.\nQuest for Elemental Crests #The story follows him after a great demon war, where he sets out to reclaim six powerful elemental crests that grant control over fire, earth, water, air, time, and heaven. These crests allow you to transform into different forms, each with unique abilities that open up new paths, giving the game a structure reminiscent of early Metroidvania titles. The gameplay blends precise platforming, combat, and exploration. You can fly short distances, cling to walls, and use various projectile attacks. Levels are non-linear, with a world map that lets you revisit areas to uncover secrets and optional bosses once you’ve unlocked new abilities.\nSecrets and Challenge #For me the best aspect of this title are it\u0026rsquo;s secrets, in general the mainline story is very short, but it really shines when you decide to go 100%. I highly recommend doing so, this really feels like the intended way of playing this. The difficulty is tough but fair, it demands patience and mastery of Firebrand’s powers. The most difficult sections for me were the bosses, made worse by the lack of QOL of modern gaming such as more frequent checkpoints, meaning that you got very little time to learn the boss patterns and try again.\nBosses, Visuals, Soundtrack #This is why I advise using save states for the bosses, and don\u0026rsquo;t feel ashamed if doing so, this is one of the many flawed games when it comes to the difficulty spikes of the back in the day game design. Visually, this game is stunning for its time, the sprite work is detailed and expressive, with gothic architecture, eerie lighting, and foreboding enemy designs that create a beautifully grim atmosphere. The OST complements this perfectly, featuring haunting organ melodies and moody ambient tones that reinforce the game’s dark tone.\nCult Classic Recognition #Despite its brilliance, this game was a commercial failure upon release, partly due to poor marketing and stiff competition in 1994. However, in hindsight, it’s regarded as one of the SNES’s finest hidden gems, a moody, artistically ambitious, and mechanically refined platformer that showcases Capcom at its creative peak. If you enjoy atmospheric action games with exploration and challenge, this title is an unforgettable experience that still holds up remarkably well today.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/demon-crest/","section":"Posts","summary":"A dark fantasy action-platformer, being the 3rd entry in the Gargoyle\u0026rsquo;s Quest series, a spin-off from Ghosts \u0026rsquo;n Goblins.","title":"Demon's Crest"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBirth of Stylish Combat #The very first entry to the Devil May Cry franchise is widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre. The MC is called Dante, a charismatic and cocky demon hunter on a mission to defeat the powerful demon Mundus and unravel the mysteries of his own past. From the very first moments, the game sets a dark, gothic tone with its foreboding castle setting, intricate level design, and cinematic cutscenes that feel almost like interactive movies. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly rewarding, blending swordplay, acrobatics, and gun combat.\nStyle-Driven Action Mastery #You can chain together elaborate combos, juggling enemies in the air and switching seamlessly between melee and ranged attacks. It encourages you to fight with style, awarding rankings from “D” to “Stylish” based not just on survival, but on creativity, speed, and variety in combat. And despite score systems being a common thing in nowadays gameplay design, the more dynamic, unique and full of personality one like the first DMC\u0026rsquo;s implementation was a standout back in the day. Boss battles are particularly memorable, often requiring both skill and strategy, and each one feels like a true test of mastery.\nInnovative Combat Foundations #The controls and combat systems were innovative for their time, giving you a sense of freedom and power rarely seen in early 2000s action games. The OST complement the intense action, from epic orchestral pieces to edgy rock tracks, further enhancing the experience, though I think that this very first DMC had a more shy style for it\u0026rsquo;s songs when compared to subsequent entries. While some people might find the difficulty steep and the camera occasionally challenging, these aspects also add to the sense of accomplishment when battles are won.\nA Genre-Defining Legacy #Beyond gameplay, this game established a lasting legacy with its over-the-top style, memorable protagonist, and influence on countless action titles that followed. It spawned a franchise that continues to be celebrated today, and its blend of challenge, style, and narrative depth makes it a standout title on it\u0026rsquo;s platform that still holds up remarkably well. This is truly one of the milestones in gaming history, especially when it comes to this genre, a must-play if you have the opportunity to experience this in modern platforms. Despite my high praise on this title, I still think this sits in the weak spot of the franchise, though not in a bad way, but simply because it\u0026rsquo;s sequels improved upon it\u0026rsquo;s foundations much more that makes the OG DMC a little gray in comparison.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/devil-may-cry/","section":"Posts","summary":"A widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre.","title":"Devil May Cry"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 11 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nA Fresh Direction #This title marks a bold and refreshing detour from the traditional Tomb Raider formula. Instead of the usual third-person adventure with cinematic storytelling, this spin-off embraces an isometric camera view, arcade-style combat, and cooperative puzzle-solving. The result is a tightly designed action-adventure game that feels both nostalgic and inventive. The story is light but effective, Lara teams up with Totec, an ancient Mayan warrior resurrected to help stop the evil spirit Xolotl from plunging the world into darkness. The narrative mostly serves as a backdrop for the gameplay, which is where the real fun lies.\nCoop-Centric Gameplay #The campaign can be played solo or in two-player coop, and it’s in coop that the game truly shines, many puzzles and combat encounters are cleverly designed to encourage teamwork, with Lara’s grappling hook and Totec’s spear-throwing creating dynamic ways to navigate levels. Unortunately for me, like many coop titles that I played, I experienced this one alone, and it was still an enjoyable experience, so I still recommend this title for solo players. The gameplay blends twin-stick shooting, platforming, and environmental puzzles seamlessly. Combat feels fast and responsive, with a nice variety of weapons, relics, and artifacts that modify abilities and encourage experimentation.\nClever Puzzles \u0026amp; Atmosphere #The puzzles strike a satisfying balance between clever and intuitive, rewarding exploration without being frustrating. The isometric perspective gives the game a distinct arcade feel, though it can sometimes make depth perception tricky during jumps or traps. Visually, the game still holds up well for its age, the environments, ancient temples, crumbling ruins, and trap-filled chambers, are detailed and atmospheric. The OST complements the setting with an adventurous tone, and the performance is smooth even on modest hardware, so this is a well-suited game for older systems, or even for handhelds.\nAn Underrated Adventure #Overall, this title is a well-crafted, fast-paced adventure that proves the franchise can thrive outside its usual formula. Its tight mechanics, inventive coop design, and rewarding gameplay loop make it one of the most underrated gems of it\u0026rsquo;s time. Despite me praising it so much, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a must-play outside of the fans to this franchise, or if you are really into story-driven coop campaign titles, which there aren\u0026rsquo;t really that much to play anyway when it comes to these types of videogames.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title marks a bold and refreshing detour from the traditional Tomb Raider formula.","title":"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nModern Reimagined Classic #This title is a modern reimagining of the 1997 cult classic, rather than simply copying the old formula, the reboot successfully fuses nostalgic ‘90s shooter energy with slick, modern gameplay and visuals. The MC is called Lo Wang, a sharp-tongued mercenary who gets tangled in a demonic invasion after a botched mission to retrieve a mysterious sword. What follows is a blend of intense first-person combat, dark humor, and mythological storytelling with a surprising amount of heart.\nBrutal Fluid Combat #The game’s biggest strength lies in its combat system, which balances frantic gunfights with brutally satisfying swordplay. The katana mechanics are deep and responsive, letting you chain slashes, decapitations, and special attacks with precision. Firearms like shotguns and crossbows complement the melee action perfectly, giving you multiple ways to approach every encounter. The arenas are designed to encourage mobility and experimentation, rewarding aggressive play and skillful combos.\nStyle, Sound, Personality #Visually, it still looks sharp, with colorful environments and detailed enemies. The OST amps up the action with pulse-pounding energy, while the sound design sells every slash and explosion. What really makes the experience stand out, though, is the personality, Lo Wang’s mix of cheesy one-liners, self-awareness, and unexpected depth makes him one of the more memorable FPS protagonists of the 2010s. There are very few hidden gems of the FPS genre of this era of gaming, one of them is this one, along with titles such as The Darkness, they are very similar when it comes to the gameplay, there is a lot to like on this one if you enjoy this kind of shooter.\nEmotional, Stylish Reboot #While the story isn’t groundbreaking, it manages to surprise with genuine emotional beats and a well-paced finale. You also get some story-telling via comic-book-like cutscenes, similar to Max Payne, but instead of the Noir tone, this time you get a more anime-like art-style, with very good animated, beautifully designed, and with amazing voice-acting. Overall, this title is a stylish, fun, and brutally entertaining reboot that honors its roots while carving out its own identity as one of the most satisfying single-player shooters of its time.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/shadow-warrior/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern reimagining of the 1997 cult classic, fusing nostalgic ‘90s shooter energy with slick, modern gameplay and visuals.","title":"Shadow Warrior"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDefining 16-Bit Transition #The 4th mainline entry to the Castlevania franchise is one of the finest examples of how a series can successfully transition into a new generation of hardware. Serving as both a remake and reimagining of the original Castlevania from the NES, it refines nearly every aspect of the classic formula. The MC is called Simon Belmont, armed with his iconic whip and tasked with venturing through Dracula’s monstrous castle to defeat the Count and his legion of undead minions.\nRevolutionized Classic Controls #The gameplay builds on the series trademark mix of precision platforming and punishing combat, but introduces smoother controls that feel revolutionary compared to earlier titles. You can now whip in eight directions, use his whip as a grappling tool, and move more freely through intricately designed stages. This control overhaul makes this game one of the most fluid and satisfying entries in the franchise’s classic era.\nMode-7 Gothic Showcase #Visually, the game is a showcase of the SNES’s capabilities. Konami used the console’s Mode 7 effects to create dizzying rotating rooms, shifting corridors, and surreal backgrounds that gave you a sense of being inside a living, breathing nightmare. The attention to detail in the gothic architecture, eerie lighting, and atmospheric animations adds to the sense of foreboding that defines the Castlevania series.\nIconic Symphonic Soundscape #The OST, deserves special praise, it blends haunting organ melodies, baroque-inspired arrangements, and driving percussion to perfectly complement the dark fantasy setting. Tracks like “Simon’s Theme” and “Clockwork Mansion” have since become iconic, showcasing the SNES’s sound chip at its best, and solidifying even more one of the best aspects of the Castlevania franchise, the high quality and memorable soundtracks.\nTimeless Castlevania Masterpiece #While this game remains linear compared to later Metroidvania titles like SOTN, its pacing, variety, and challenge make it deeply rewarding. It stands as both a nostalgic tribute to the series roots and a technical masterpiece of early 16-bit gaming. Even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, it’s still celebrated for its atmosphere, music, and perfect blend of horror and action. This is a must-play for fans of the Castlevania franchise such as myself, and with the recent collections being re-released it is an easy recommedation.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-castlevania-iv/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is one of the finest examples of how a series can successfully transition into a new generation of hardware.","title":"Super Castlevania IV"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nRefined Espionage Sequel #This title builds upon the foundation of the first game, delivering a more polished and ambitious experience that cements its place among the PlayStation’s best action titles. The game continues the story of special agents Gabe Logan and Lian Xing as they unravel a government conspiracy surrounding the deadly Syphon Filter virus. The sequel picks up immediately after the events of the original, thrusting players into a fast-paced narrative filled with espionage, betrayal, and moral ambiguity.\nCinematic Evolution Arrives #The story is more cinematic this time, told through frequent cutscenes and voice acting that was impressive for its era. The writing also takes a darker tone, giving both protagonists more emotional depth as they find themselves hunted by the very agency they once served. As for the gameplay, it refines nearly every aspect of the original, the combination of third-person shooting and stealth action feels tighter, with smoother controls and improved targeting. Levels are larger and more varied, taking you from snowy mountain bases to desert complexes and underground laboratories.\nDynamic Mission Variety #Each mission encourages a mix of stealth, strategy, and all-out gunfights, creating a dynamic flow that keeps the experience fresh. It even has some sections in which you have backup from other soldiers, into the action, or have to make sure they don\u0026rsquo;t die since they are all part of your team, making it a much more believable experience. The game’s arsenal is another highlight, from silenced pistols and machine guns to explosive weapons and, of course, the infamous high-voltage Taser that lets you set enemies ablaze from a distance.\nSmarter Stealth Focus #Enemy AI is noticeably improved, forcing you to plan their approach rather than charge in blindly. And compared to the previous entry, this time around you have a lot more stealth sections, making this sequel a more varied entry to the action-packed one that was introduced in the very first title. Visually, the game pushes the PlayStation hardware to its limits, while character models and environments look blocky today, the atmosphere, enhanced by strong lighting effects and a tense soundtrack, was impressive back in the day.\nA Defining Classic #In retrospect, this game represents a high point for late-era PlayStation action games. Its mix of espionage storytelling, tactical gameplay, and memorable moments made it one of the defining titles of its generation. This was a standout stealth-action sequel that improves on nearly every aspect of the original, this title remains a thrilling and influential entry in PlayStation history, one of the most memorable titles of it\u0026rsquo;s platform, and of the era that it lived in.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/syphon-filter-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"This sequel delivers a more polished and ambitious experience that cements its place among the PlayStation’s best titles.","title":"Syphon Filter 2"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAtmospheric Sci-Fi Awakening #This title is an outstanding indie metroidvania that manages to feel both nostalgic and refreshingly original. Developed almost entirely by a single person, it’s a remarkable achievement in atmosphere, design, and storytelling. The MC is called Trace, a scientist who wakes up in a strange, hostile alien world after a lab accident. From the opening moments, Axiom Verge establishes a haunting tone through its glitchy visuals, cryptic dialogue, and droning synth OST. One of it\u0026rsquo;s standouts to me is it\u0026rsquo;s OST, not just because I\u0026rsquo;m biased towards Synth music in general, but because it\u0026rsquo;s OST is at the same level of giants such as Metroid. The environments, industrial ruins, pulsing organic tunnels, and machine-infested caverns.\nSurreal Exploration Mastery #The game’s world design is clearly inspired by Super Metroid, but it is more surreal and experimental, blending biotech horror with a subtle undercurrent of existential dread. The gameplay revolves around exploration and gradual empowerment. Every new weapon or gadget, like the Address Disruptor, which “glitches” enemies and terrain to reveal secrets, adds layers of discovery. Combat feels deliberate, and though enemy variety can be repetitive, the sheer number of weapons (over 20) keeps things interesting. The boss battles are large, tense encounters that demand precision and pattern recognition.\nGlitch-Driven Narrative Depth #One of it\u0026rsquo;s strongest traits is how it uses its retro aesthetic to enhance its identity rather than merely imitate old games. The visual “glitches” are not just stylistic, they’re part of the world and narrative, blurring the line between game and code. The story, told through scattered terminals and brief dialogue, encourages interpretation, leaving you to piece together its larger mysteries. And this is one of my favorite aspects of this title, since I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to like this kind of approach to story-telling, so if you are like me, this is one of the best experiences you can have when it comes to expanded lore beyond in-game events.\nChallenging Yet Essential #If there’s one drawback, it’s that navigation can sometimes feel cumbersome, especially without a fast-travel system, similar to the experience you\u0026rsquo;ll face if you play the early, and less mature, Metroid implementations. Still, the sense of exploration and discovery is rarely lost. In summary, this game is an atmospheric, imaginative, and deeply crafted tribute to the 16-bit era. It’s a testament to what one creator can achieve, an essential experience for fans of exploration-driven action games. This is definitely one of the best games that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, not just for it\u0026rsquo;s genre, but in general, especially because the story is the perfect fit for me, with alternative universes, identity and even time travel, but I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil anything not to ruin any experiences. It is an absolute must-play if you like Metroidvanias to any extent.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/axiom-verge/","section":"Posts","summary":"An outstanding indie metroidvania that manages to feel both nostalgic and refreshingly original.","title":"Axiom Verge"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNarrative Grand Finale #This title stands as the climactic finale of one of gaming’s most intricate and ambitious storylines. The game unites the dual protagonists Kain and Raziel, whose intertwined fates have defined the Legacy of Kain series since its inception. For long-time fans, Defiance delivers a richly rewarding narrative payoff, a conclusion that ties up many of the saga’s philosophical and time-bending threads while maintaining the somber, gothic tone that has always defined the world of Nosgoth. The writing is poetic and grandiose, with themes of destiny, free will, and redemption explored through complex dialogue and powerful performances.\nAtmosphere and Mechanics #The voice acting elevates the experience to a level that was rarely seen in games of that era. Visually, it was a strong effort for its time, the environments brim with gothic architecture, atmospheric lighting, and haunting details that immerse the you in a decaying, cursed world. The transitions between the material and spectral realms, an iconic mechanic from the Soul Reaver games, are fluid and striking, reinforcing Raziel’s tragic existence as a creature caught between life and death. And while it is simpler compared to it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor, especially when it comes to puzzle-solving and platforming, it is still a satisfying mechanic to interact with.\nGameplay Shortcomings Exposed #Each location feels carefully crafted, contributing to a sense of history and decay that strengthens the storytelling. The gameplay, however, doesn’t quite live up to the narrative’s excellence, while you can finally control both Kain and Raziel in the same title, their combat styles feel more similar than they should. Kain’s brute force and blood-draining attacks contrast with Raziel’s spectral powers and puzzle-solving focus, but mechanically the two share too much overlap. Combat can become repetitive, with limited enemy variety and an overreliance on basic combos. The fixed camera angles are among the most common criticisms, often making battles disorienting and exploration frustrating.\nFlawed Yet Impactful #Combined with the lack of an in-game map or clear objectives, progression can sometimes feel more like a chore than an adventure. Despite these flaws, it succeeds where it matters most, delivering a satisfying end to a story that had spanned nearly a decade. The dialogue remains intelligent and philosophical, the atmosphere thick with gothic grandeur, and the character arcs of Kain and Raziel reach emotionally powerful conclusions. It’s a game that prioritizes storytelling over mechanical polish, offering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.\nFor Fans Only #For fans of the series, this game is essential, a dark, poetic farewell to two of gaming’s most memorable antiheroes. Newcomers may find its dated mechanics and awkward camera challenging, but those willing to push through will uncover one of the most narratively rich worlds in video game history. It’s an imperfect masterpiece, flawed in execution, but unforgettable in vision, and personally I would only recommend this for fans of the franchise, it most definitely can\u0026rsquo;t win any more fans at this point in the franchise\u0026rsquo;s story-line.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/legacy-of-kain-defiance/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title stands as the climactic finale of one of gaming’s most intricate and ambitious storylines.","title":"Legacy of Kain Defiance"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Model Sequel #The second mainline entry to the Max Payne franchise is a near-perfect example of how to build a sequel that respects its predecessor while deepening every aspect of its world, gameplay, and emotional weight.

Released in an era when story-driven shooters were still finding their footing, it stood out as a masterclass in noir storytelling and game design.\nNoir-Tinged Redemption #The MC is yet again Max Payne, a man still haunted by the ghosts of his past, caught between grief, guilt, and a longing for redemption. His reunion with Mona Sax, a mysterious contract killer, pulls him into a dark spiral of crime, conspiracy, and doomed love. The narrative is steeped in the language and style of classic film noir, hard-boiled monologues, shadowy alleyways, and moral ambiguity at every turn. As for the gameplay, it refines the original’s core mechanic, bullet time, into a smoother, more responsive system.\nCinematic Gunplay Mastery #Diving through gunfights in slow motion never loses its thrill, and the improved physics, make every bullet impact feel weighty and cinematic. The level design encourages creative combat, blending tight corridors with larger set pieces that showcase Remedy’s mastery of pacing. Even on repeated playthroughs, the combat remains satisfying, a blend of strategy and spectacle that was years ahead of its time.

The story is told through beautifully drawn comic book panels, a signature stylistic choice from the first game that gives it a distinctive identity. These panels, paired with Max’s introspective narration, allow for a seamless blend of gameplay and storytelling, one that feels literary, cinematic, and deeply personal. The pacing is almost perfect, the game never overstays its welcome, delivering a complete and emotionally satisfying arc in roughly six to eight hours.\nA Lasting Masterpiece #This game is a tragic, beautifully written, and expertly crafted experience. It blends sharp storytelling, unforgettable atmosphere, and exhilarating gameplay into one of the most cohesive and emotionally charged shooters in gaming history. Even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, it remains a shining example of what happens when style and substance meet perfectly, a noir masterpiece that still hurts, and still dazzles.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/max-payne-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"A near-perfect example of how to build a sequel that respects its predecessor while deepening every aspect of its world.","title":"Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBalanced Final Chapter #This title brings the Sands of Time trilogy to a strong and satisfying close. After the darker and more violent tone of Warrior Within, this entry strikes a better balance between the emotional storytelling of the first game and the intense action of the second. The Prince returns to Babylon, only to find his kingdom in ruins and his past actions coming back to haunt him. What follows is a tightly woven tale of redemption, inner conflict, and fate. As for the gameplay, it refines the series’ signature mix of fluid platforming, acrobatics, and time manipulation.\nRefined Parkour Combat #The parkour sequences remain the highlight, leaping across walls, swinging from poles, and dodging deadly traps feels as smooth and rewarding as ever. Combat has been improved with the addition of the “Speed Kill” system, allowing for stealthy and cinematic takedowns. The introduction of the “Dark Prince,” a twisted version of the protagonist who uses a chain weapon and gradually loses health over time, adds an exciting layer of risk and variety to the experience. In my opinion this mechanic was not explored enough since the scale of this game was insanely small compared to Warrior Within, which in comparison, can even start to make it feel like the previous entry was almost an open-world metriodvania, even if it is not one.\nEmotional Trilogy Finale #Visually, the PlayStation 2 version shows the hardware’s limits, but the game’s art direction, moody lighting, and atmospheric OST help maintain a sense of grandeur. The story’s pacing, combined with a heartfelt ending, gives the trilogy a strong emotional closure. While occasional camera issues and some dated textures remain, it succeeds in blending action, puzzle-solving, and storytelling into a cohesive and memorable adventure, a fitting farewell to one of the most iconic heroes of the PS2 era. This was one of the first PlayStation 2 games that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I finished it without using a memory card simply because I was blown away by it, one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s platform.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title brings the Sands of Time trilogy to a strong and satisfying close.","title":"Prince of Persia The Two Thrones"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nA Landmark FPS Debut #The very first Turok entry was a landmark release for the Nintendo 64 and one of the first console first-person shooters to show that the genre could thrive outside of PC. The game was based on a lesser-known comic book series but quickly built its own identity through its mix of prehistoric and sci-fi elements. The MC is called Turok, a time-traveling Native American warrior tasked with stopping the evil Campaigner from using an ancient artifact to control the universe.\nScale, Exploration, Verticality #What made it so impressive back in the day was its sense of scale and atmosphere. The game featured large, open 3D environments filled with dinosaurs, mutants, and alien creatures, all rendered in a fluid 30 frames per second on hardware that was still new to 3D gaming. Its level design emphasized exploration and verticality, with hidden paths, keys, and portals scattered throughout. This encouraged you to backtrack and master the sprawling stages rather than simply blasting through them. It can even sometimes feel like a Metroidvania, since you need to huntdown key items in order to progress, about the only missing similarity is weapons and equipment which enables new areas.\nIconic Weapons and Flaws #The arsenal was another highlight, from the trusty bow and arrow to futuristic energy weapons, it offered a variety of tools that felt powerful and satisfying to use. The game’s fast movement, responsive controls, and fluid aiming system helped it stand out among early console shooters, even if the Nintendo 64’s single analog stick made precise aiming a challenge. That said, the game shows its age today, the notorious fog, used to hide the console’s limited draw distance, can make environments feel repetitive, and the platforming sequences are often clumsy. I recommend playing the modern re-releases since they have a lot of QOL improvements to enhance the experience, compared to the OG implementation.\nAmbitious, Influential Classic #Yet despite these flaws, this game remains an ambitious and influential title, it helped pave the way for later shooters on consoles, blending exploration, action, and atmosphere in a way few games of its time could match. Revisiting it today, whether on original hardware or through the remastered PC version, reveals a game that was ahead of its time, primitive in some ways, but bold in design and vision. This is one of the most unique shooters that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I don\u0026rsquo;t rank it higher simply because I played the original version, but the remaster is for sure the best way to experience this, and I would give it five stars if I ever play it.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/turok-dinosaur-hunter/","section":"Posts","summary":"A landmark release for the N64 and one of the first console FPSs to show that the genre could thrive outside of PC.","title":"Turok Dinosaur Hunter"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation Portable ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nA More Personal Kratos #This title is a remarkable entry in the legendary franchise, serving as an interquel between the original God of War and its sequel. The game tells a more intimate story about Kratos’s past, exploring his lingering trauma and the haunting memories of his long-lost brother, Deimos. While the mainline titles often focused on large-scale vengeance and divine rebellion, Ghost of Sparta narrows its lens to deliver a character-driven tale that humanizes the Ghost of Sparta without softening his fury.\nOrigins, Family, Tragedy #The story begins with Kratos plagued by visions of his mortal past. His quest to uncover the truth leads him to Atlantis, the realm of Poseidon, and ultimately to a desperate attempt to rescue Deimos from the depths of the Domain of Death. This journey reveals more about Kratos’s origins, his mother Callisto, and the tragic fate of his family, themes that add emotional weight rarely seen in handheld action games. Despite being designed for a portable system, the game’s narrative pacing, voice acting, and cutscenes maintain the cinematic quality expected from the franchise, blending mythological grandeur with personal tragedy.\nConsole-Quality Portable Combat #It really doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a handheld portable game to play on-the-go, but rather a complete narrative gaming experience worth of regular consoles. As for the gameplay, it perfects the formula established by its predecessors. Combat is fast, responsive, and brutally satisfying, with a variety of combos and abilities that make each encounter feel dynamic. The introduction of new weapons, such as the Arms of Sparta, a spear and shield combination, adds tactical depth to the familiar blade-based combat. And particularly this weapon is my favorite of the entire franchise, it really makes you feel like a true spartan since this was the historically accurate weaponry that they used.\nCreative Magic and Spectacle #Magic abilities like the Eye of Atlantis and Scourge of Erinys bring creative variety to fights, ensuring that you never feel repetitive even through the most intense battles. Boss fights are another highlight, combining challenge, spectacle, and quick-time events in a way that only God of War can deliver, again, similar experience to the regular consoles. The PSP’s hardware limitations never seem to hinder the experience, instead, it showcases stunning visuals with detailed environments, smooth animations, and large-scale set pieces that rival those on home consoles of its era. Performance remains impressively stable, maintaining fluidity even during the most chaotic sequences.\nMinor Flaws, Major Impact #There are minor flaws, of course, the fixed camera can occasionally make platforming cumbersome, and the relatively short playtime (around six hours) leaves you wanting more. The game’s pacing, variety of locations, and satisfying sense of progression ensure that the adventure feels complete and memorable. In the end, this game is a shining example of what can be achieved on handheld hardware when technical ambition meets masterful design. It delivers visceral action, a compelling emotional arc, and the mythic spectacle the series is known for. Definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, or for fans of Hack\u0026rsquo;n Slash in general.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/god-of-war-ghost-of-sparta/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title serves as an interquel between the original God of War and its sequel.","title":"God of War Ghost of Sparta"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nCharming Retro Adventure #This title is a love letter to the classic top-down action-adventure of the 16-bit era, drawing clear inspiration from titles like ALTTP. Set on a charming archipelago, the game invites you to explore a vibrant world filled with secrets, side quests, and hidden treasures. Each island has its own character, from bustling towns to eerie caves, giving a sense of a living, breathing world despite its pixel-art simplicity. The visuals are bright and colorful, evoking nostalgia while still feeling fresh, and the OST complements the exploration perfectly with catchy, atmospheric melodies.\nExploration-Driven Gameplay #Gameplay centers on exploration, combat, and item-based progression. You wield swords, bows, and bombs, and can upgrade their abilities, craft items, and forage for resources. The dungeon designs are clever, providing puzzles and combat challenges that reward curiosity and experimentation. There’s a satisfying sense of progression as new tools and abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas, encouraging backtracking and thorough exploration. Many people have praised the balance of challenge and accessibility, noting that the game captures the essence of classic top-down action-adventure while adding its own charming touches.\nMinor Flaws Noted #However, some people report that controls can feel slightly stiff, especially in combat-heavy moments, and the map system is sometimes insufficient for navigation, leading to minor frustration in larger areas. Certain difficulty spikes in dungeons can feel abrupt, and while the game is engaging, its short length means the adventure can be completed relatively quickly. Despite these issues, the overall experience remains enjoyable, particularly for fans of retro-inspired indie games seeking a relaxing yet engaging adventure.\nNostalgic, Rewarding Journey #Ultimately, this game succeeds in evoking nostalgia while providing a charming, accessible top-down action-adventure experience for modern audiences. It may not reinvent the genre, but it delivers a delightful journey across its islands, full of secrets, exploration, and lighthearted adventure. For people who love classic top-down action-adventure, it’s a solid and rewarding experience. It is worth a try if you enjoy the games which inspired it such as Alundra and the already mentioned ALTTP.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ocean-heart/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a love letter to the classic top-down action-adventure of the 16-bit era.","title":"Ocean's Heart"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nPsychological Depth Unleashed #The third mainline entry to the Silent Hill franchise is one of the most mature and psychologically unsettling entries in the survival horror genre. It continues the series trademark focus on atmosphere, symbolism, and emotional depth, while delivering one of the strongest narratives in the franchise. And as much as I wished to elaborate on the main plot\u0026rsquo;s topic, it would be a shame to present spoilers, all I can say now is that it has the same level of quality as it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors. The MC is called Heather Mason, a teenage girl whose ordinary day at a shopping mall spirals into a descent through nightmarish, blood-soaked worlds. What begins as a personal journey quickly evolves into a disturbing exploration of identity, grief, and inherited trauma, ultimately tying back to the events of the first Silent Hill.\nHeather’s Human Complexity #Heather’s vulnerability, sarcasm, and humanity make her one of the most relatable and well-written protagonists in horror gaming. This is truly one of this biggest standouts compared to the previous titles, especially because the protagonist is younger this time around, making it more relatable to certain demographics in gaming. Visually, it was a technical showcase for the PlayStation 2. The use of lighting, fog, and detailed environments creates a constant sense of dread. From filthy hospital corridors to rust-covered amusement parks, every location feels alive with corruption and despair. This title is definitely the most varied one when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s environments and world, feeling like yet another element that was improved from previous entries.\nSound as Terror #The OST and ambient design elevate the experience to something truly haunting. The industrial noises, distorted radio static, and melancholic melodies perfectly mirror Heather’s emotional state and the decaying world around her. Few games use sound as effectively to manipulate mood and tension like this one does. Gameplay adheres to the series traditional structure, exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. In my opinion this game has more combat than previous mainline entries, almost all rooms have at least one enemy for you to face. The clunky controls and limited camera are sometimes criticized, but they serve the atmosphere, making every encounter feel dangerous and every step uncertain.\nRefined Horror Mastery #The puzzles range from logical to cryptic, demanding careful observation and thought rather than brute force. Though it doesn’t reinvent the formula, this game refines it beautifully. The pacing, story, and psychological intensity make it arguably the last truly great entry from Team Silent before the series later decline. This title is a masterclass in psychological horror, disturbing, elegant, and emotionally resonant. Its layered storytelling, unforgettable visuals. This is definitely a must-play since it is a landmark of how polished this genre managed to get in the PlayStation 2 platform, and one of the best ones of all time.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/silent-hill-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is one of the most mature and psychologically unsettling entries in the survival horror genre.","title":"Silent Hill 3"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nMinimalist Boss Focus #This title is an action game, often described as a “Souls-like boss rush.” Instead of exploring vast worlds or gathering loot, the game narrows its focus to a series of intense boss encounters, each representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins. This minimalist design gives it a unique rhythm, there’s no filler, no side quests, just pure combat and consequence. Its defining mechanic is that, before each fight, the protagonist must sacrifice a part of his strength. Health, stamina, defense, and even healing items are gradually stripped away, meaning that as you progress, your character grows weaker rather than stronger. It’s a bold inversion of traditional RPG progression that fits perfectly with the game’s themes of guilt, redemption, and punishment.\nPrecision-Driven Combat #The combat itself borrows heavily from Dark Souls, emphasizing deliberate movement, stamina management, and punishing precision. Each boss presents a distinct challenge, from fast and agile foes to towering monstrosities that fill the arena. Mastery comes from learning their attack patterns and exploiting small openings, which creates moments of real satisfaction when a long-fought victory is finally earned. The boss designs, both visually and mechanically, show care and variety, giving each fight its own identity despite the game’s small scope. I dare to say they rival bosses from the Dark Souls series.\nSparse Worldbuilding Issues #Visually, it adopts a dark, desaturated art style that complements its somber tone, but it lacks the atmosphere and world-building depth of its inspirations. The minimalist environments can feel empty, and the OST, though serviceable, rarely elevates the tension in meaningful ways. The storytelling is deliberately cryptic, offering glimpses of lore through brief dialogues and item descriptions, yet never developing the emotional or narrative weight that could have tied the journey together. While this approach may appeal to fans of sparse storytelling, others may find it too detached to be memorable.\nStriking but Short-Lived #It’s the kind of title that challenges you for a few hours, delivers its message, and ends before its mechanics wear thin. Ultimately, this game stands out as a creative but uneven experiment within the Souls-like genre. Its core idea, growing weaker with every victory, is brilliant in theory and effective in execution, turning each new boss fight into a test of adaptation and perseverance. Yet the limited scope, lack of progression, and uneven presentation hold it back from greatness. For people who enjoy difficult combat and thematic minimalism, it’s worth a look. But those seeking rich worlds, intricate lore, and long-term depth may find the experience too fleeting.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an action game, often described as a \u0026lsquo;Souls-like boss rush.\u0026rsquo;","title":"Sinner Sacrifice for Redemption"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 70 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAmbitious 90s RPG #This title is one of the most ambitious and memorable RPGs of the late 1990s. It stands out for its intricate storytelling, rich character development, and unique dual-layered combat system that blends traditional turn-based battles with mech-based \u0026ldquo;Gear\u0026rdquo; fights. The MC is called Fei Fong Wong, an amnesiac young man who becomes entangled in a vast and mysterious conflict spanning nations, ancient technology, and shadowy organizations. As the story unfolds, themes of identity, fate, religion, and human consciousness are explored with surprising depth for a video game of its era.\nExpansive World-Building #The world-building in Xenogears is expansive, the game introduces you to a variety of cultures, political intrigues, and moral dilemmas, giving a sense of scale and complexity that rivals even modern RPGs. The characters are equally compelling, Fei’s personal struggles are mirrored by the journeys of those around him, each with their own flaws, secrets, and motivations. The narrative does not shy away from mature and philosophical topics, making it a thought-provoking experience that resonates long after the credits roll. This one is indeed one of the golden era JRPG titles similar to FFVII, FFVI and both Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross games from back in the day.\nDual-Layered Combat #The gameplay is multi-layered, on the surface, standard turn-based combat is solid and satisfying, with a strong emphasis on timed button presses to chain attacks and unleash combos. However, the standout feature is Gear combat, where you pilot giant mechs in tactical battles that feel both powerful and strategic. This dual-layered system adds depth and variety, keeping combat engaging throughout much of the game. Some mechanics, such as random encounters and extensive menu navigation, may feel cumbersome by today’s standards, but they were typical of the era.\nMemorable OST and Visuals #The OST is another highlight, ranging from emotional piano pieces to epic orchestral tracks, perfectly complementing the game’s dramatic moments. And this is not an unique trait of this title, it is indeed one of the best OSTs that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, and this is a common thing when it comes to JRPGs in general. Visually, the game blends 2D sprite-based characters with 3D environments, creating a distinctive style that still has charm today, even if it shows its age. I loved this aesthetic back in the day, started with titles such as Resident Evil, and I wished more games used this feature nowadays.\nFlawed Final Act #The game’s major criticism lies in its pacing and storytelling toward the end. Due to time and budget constraints, some plot elements are delivered through long text sequences rather than fully animated cutscenes, which can feel overwhelming. This is definitely one of the worst aspects of this title, I knew it before playing it for the first time, but I never thought it would be so bad as people made it out to be, and unfortunately, it is even worse than I thought. Despite this, the ending is still emotionally impactful and leaves a lasting impression.\nTimeless Narrative Masterpiece #Overall, this game is a masterpiece of narrative-driven RPG design. Its combination of deep storytelling, compelling characters, philosophical themes, and innovative combat make it a must-play for fans of classic role-playing games. While not perfect, it’s a game that remains influential and beloved decades after its release. It\u0026rsquo;ll continue to influence other titles of today\u0026rsquo;s JRPG modern games, one of them which I highly recommend is Chained Echoes, which has a similar two-layered combat system, quite similar to Xenogears. This game is definitely a must-play for fans of RPGs in general, not just of JRPGs, it is one of the best games of all time in my opinion, despite the last sections being one of the worst gaming experiences I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/xenogears/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of the most ambitious and memorable RPGs of the late 1990s.","title":"Xenogears"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nNarrative-Driven Horror Shift #This second Amnesia entry is a first-person psychological horror game, it game shifts away from the mechanics-heavy survival horror of its predecessor and ventures into a more narrative-driven, atmospheric experience. Set in Victorian-era London at the dawn of the 20th century, the MC is called Oswald Mandus, who awakens in his mansion with fragmented memories, haunted by feverish visions and the cries of his missing children. Drawn into the bowels of his estate and beyond, Mandus discovers a massive, nightmarish machine beneath the city, one that reflects the monstrous consequences of human ambition and industrial greed.\nAtmosphere Over Mechanics #From the moment it begins, it envelops you in a suffocating sense of dread, with moody writing, audio logs, and gradual revelations. The game abandons traditional survival mechanics, there’s no inventory, no sanity meter, and no oil or tinderboxes to worry about. Instead, it emphasizes immersion through environmental storytelling and sound design. And this is what separate the community the most, since this sequel felt more like a walking-simulator than a survival horror game, since it removed the beloved elements of the more traditional first entry to the series. The lighting and level design reinforce this atmosphere, blending gothic architecture with the grim aesthetics of factories, slaughterhouses, and catacombs to create a world that feels both human and inhuman at once.\nPsychological Focused Terror #While this change in design philosophy alienated some fans of the original Amnesia, it also gave the game a unique identity. The horror here is more psychological than mechanical, it’s rooted in Mandus’s guilt and the philosophical implications of his actions rather than constant jump scares or direct threats. The story builds slowly, and while enemy encounters are sparse, their rarity amplifies the tension when they finally occur. Despite its strengths, the game’s simplification of gameplay systems was divisive. The puzzles are simple, the exploration limited, and the sense of danger less constant than in The Dark Descent.\nBold but Flawed Experiment #In the end, this game stands as a bold, if controversial, reinterpretation of what horror can be. It replaces the frantic terror of its predecessor with slow-burning dread and philosophical unease. Though it may not deliver the same level of mechanical depth or intensity, it offers something more cerebral, a tragic, gothic meditation on invention, morality, and the human cost of progress. As much as I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Amnesia, and survival horror in general, I simply cannot recommend this title, it is no a very good experience and not worth the time, even though it is quite a short game.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs/","section":"Posts","summary":"This sequel shifts from the mechanics-heavy survival horror, into a more narrative-driven, atmospheric experience.","title":"Amnesia A Machine for Pigs"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBrutal Melee Focus #This title is a first-person melee action game, it combines a heavy-metal aesthetic with “souls-like” combat mechanics and old-school level design, focusing entirely on close-quarters combat rather than ranged attacks. The game’s atmosphere is distinct, brutal, stylish, and drenched in metal music, giving it a unique tone that stands out among other indie titles of its era. The combat is the clear highlight, weapons feel heavy, strikes are satisfying, and timing your attacks, parries, and dodges brings a rewarding sense of rhythm. A lot of people praised how the gameplay feels impactful once you master the mechanics.\nLinear but Stylish #The world design, while linear, has a handcrafted charm, and the OST complements the action perfectly. The overall experience is concise, lasting around eight to ten hours, which works in its favor by keeping the pacing tight. On the downside, Elderborn can feel repetitive due to limited enemy variety and occasionally awkward level design. Some people found the combat animations a bit clunky, and the story is minimal, more a backdrop than a driving force. It’s a game that lives and dies by its combat system, and if you don’t click with its melee focus, there isn’t much else to keep you engaged.\nA Short Hidden Gem #Overall, this game is a solid indie experience for fans of skill-based, first-person melee combat. It’s stylish, fast and even if a bit rough around the edges. For people seeking a short but intense action fix, it’s a hidden gem worth checking out, a focused. If you even remotely like the idea of a brutal first-person melee game than you can\u0026rsquo;t find a better one than this. I would also recommend this for fans of the Soulslike genre since it has all of it\u0026rsquo;s elements, despite the heavy change of gameplay perspective, it still feels like one.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/elderborn/","section":"Posts","summary":"A first-person melee action game, it combines a heavy-metal aesthetic with “souls-like” combat.","title":"Elderborn"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nFrozen World Warfare #This title is a third-person shooter set on the frozen planet E.D.N.

The game’s icy setting gives it a distinctive atmosphere, with blizzards, crumbling bases, and vast snowy plains rendered impressively for its time. The use of thermal energy as both a survival mechanic and gameplay resource adds tension, forcing you to stay aggressive in order to stay alive. Combat feels dynamic, especially when piloting the massive “Vital Suits,” which let you wield heavy weapons and battle towering bosses.\nSpectacle With Flaws #The enemy designs and scale of encounters often feel cinematic, giving a sense of constant danger and spectacle. However, despite the strong presentation, the game suffers from repetitive mission structures and uneven pacing, with levels that can feel linear and overly similar. The story, centered on revenge and corporate conspiracies, serves more as a backdrop than a driving force. Despite its flaws, this game remains a memorable action experience thanks to its unique setting and ambitious visuals, even if its gameplay loop doesn’t quite live up to its striking premise.\nUnderrated Franchise Legacy #It was one of the last games that I played on my very first computer, and it ran very poorly, but I struggled through the low-FPS count from start to finish because I was thrilled with the gameplay, especially when it comes to the mecha feature. This is one of the most unique Capcom\u0026rsquo;s titles and I wished this franchise had more care and love by it\u0026rsquo;s developers. Unfortunately they let this great idea die out after three entries, in which the 3rd one felt more like a Dead Space clone than an actual Lost Planet entry.

It continues the story of Zero, a legendary Reploid warrior battling against Neo Arcadia in a war-torn future where the line between hero and villain has become blurred. Unlike its predecessors, Zero 3 brings a smoother difficulty curve, a more accessible upgrade system, and an enhanced sense of pacing that keeps the action engaging without overwhelming newcomers. And this is a downer for me because I quite enjoy the higher difficulty levels of the predecessors to this entry.\nTight, Evolved Gameplay #As for the gameplay, the controls feel incredibly tight and responsive, a hallmark of the series, but this installment perfects the formula. The addition of the Recoil Rod, a new weapon capable of attacking enemies at close range or propelling Zero to higher platforms, adds a layer of mobility and versatility to combat. The returning weapons, like the Z-Saber and Buster Shot, are as satisfying as ever, rewarding precision and skill. Levels are more thoughtfully designed, with better checkpoints and fewer moments of cheap difficulty, making each mission feel fair yet challenging.\nImproved Cyber Elf System #The Cyber Elf system, a unique feature in the Zero series, receives one of its best overhauls here. Instead of punishing players for using Cyber Elves (small helper programs that grant bonuses), it introduces a subtler customization approach through the new “Satellite” system. This allows for strategic benefits without sacrificing rank, encouraging experimentation and adding meaningful variety to gameplay styles. This was a needed addition since the gameplay is somewhat simplistic compared to the non-hand-held entries to the franchise, which are not very complex to begin with.\nStriking Visuals and Sound #Visually, the game is a showcase of what the GBA could do at its peak, the sprite work is remarkably detailed, animations are smooth, and environments burst with atmosphere, from the metallic corridors of enemy bases to the desolate wastelands that set the tone of Zero’s bleak world. The OST, full of high-energy electronic rock, amplifies the intensity of battle while evoking a sense of melancholy fitting for its dystopian setting, despite not being as good as the mainline OSTs, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint. Beyond its technical achievements, it excels in storytelling, it deepens the lore of the Mega Man universe, exploring themes of identity, loyalty, and the cost of war.\nPersonal, High-Stakes Narrative #The narrative feels more personal, showing Zero as both a soldier and a symbol of resistance. Its boss fights are memorable not only for their creative design but also for how they reflect the game’s moral and emotional stakes, displaying dialogs at the beginning of each fight, to bring some meaning to the things happening in the background. Overall, this game captures the essence of classic Mega Man while pushing it forward with maturity and polish. It’s a near-perfect blend of speed, precision, and style, a definitive action-platformer for the GBA and a high point for the Zero saga.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-zero-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title entry stands as one of the most refined and polished entries in the entire Mega Man franchise.","title":"Mega Man Zero 3"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nDual-Protagonist Stealth Focus #This Tenchu etry is a stealth-action game that continues the dark, atmospheric tradition of the Tenchu series, set in feudal Japan.

The game features four classic heroes, the Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf, each offering distinct playstyles that encourage teamwork. The Warrior is all about brute strength and close-range combat, the Valkyrie balances offense and defense with her shield, the Wizard combines elemental spells in a system reminiscent of Magicka, and the Elf focuses on speed and ranged attacks.\nDiverse Hero Playstyles #Particularly I liked the Warrior and the Valkyrie the most, and was highly intrigued to try to master the Wizard, but even though I played through the entirety of Magicka 1 and 2, I couldnt even begin to understand this character. The Wizard is definitely the most complex one to play, and the most powerful at the same time, it almost has limitless effectiveness because of how flexible his playstyle is. This diversity keeps combat fresh, especially in multiplayer, where coordination becomes essential for survival. Visually, the game uses a clean, dark fantasy aesthetic that fits its dungeon-crawling roots.\nChaotic Dungeon Action #Levels are filled with hordes of enemies, gold, traps, and destructible objects, keeping the action frantic and rewarding. The tongue-in-cheek narrator adds personality and humor, poking fun at players’ mistakes or greed in a way that pays homage to the arcade original’s taunts (“Wizard needs food, badly!”). Despite these strengths, Gauntlet can become repetitive. The level design relies heavily on similar enemy waves and room layouts, and the progression system, focused on collecting gold to unlock relics or upgrades, can feel grindy over time.\nBest With Friends #Solo play also lacks the chaotic energy that makes co-op so enjoyable, emphasizing that the game is best experienced with friends, either locally or online. I played through the campaign mostly solo, but I sometimes play with a friend and I highly recommend doing so, it is a much more enjoyable experience, though playing alone is also pretty much viable. This game succeeds as a faithful, fast-paced revival that thrives on cooperative mayhem. It’s a blast for short sessions with friends but doesn’t quite have the variety or depth to sustain long-term solo play.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gauntlet/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern reimagining of the beloved 1985 arcade classic, it preserves the chaotic, cooperative dungeon-crawling spirit.","title":"Gauntlet"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCompanionship and Survival #This title is a psychological survival horror game that stands out for its haunting atmosphere and unique companion mechanics. The MC is called Fiona Belli, a young woman who wakes up trapped inside a gothic castle after a car accident. Isolated and defenseless, she must rely on her companion, a dog named Hewie, to explore the castle, solve puzzles, and evade relentless pursuers. The relationship between Fiona and Hewie is central to the experience, with trust and obedience shaping how effectively he can help you survive.\nOppressive Horror Atmosphere #The game’s greatest strength lies in its tension and atmosphere. The eerie castle feels oppressive and alive, filled with unsettling details and threatening stalkers who pursue Fiona with disturbing persistence. The panic system, which distorts the screen and controls when Fiona is frightened, is an inspired touch that immerses the player in her vulnerability. Visually, it makes impressive use of the PS2’s hardware, delivering realistic environments and lighting that amplify the dread.\nSlow, Tense Gameplay #However, the game’s structure can become repetitive, cycling through a pattern of being hunted, hiding, and solving puzzles. The pacing is deliberate and slow, which enhances tension but may frustrate players expecting faster action. Though if you come to this game expecting something like modern Resident Evil, than this one is not for you, this title is even slower than the very first RE entry, which is great for fans of oldschool survival horror. The controls are somewhat stiff, and while the story’s premise is intriguing, it doesn’t always deliver deep character development or a strong narrative payoff.\nCult Horror Classic #Despite these flaws, this game remains a memorable and underrated entry in the survival horror genre. Its focus on fear, helplessness, and psychological unease, combined with the emotional bond between Fiona and Hewie, gives it a distinctive identity. Though some people gave it mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a loyal cult following for its atmosphere, originality, and haunting tone. This is a must-play if you are a fan of survival horror, especially if you like the more slower versions of them like the first entries of RE an Silent Hill.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/haunting-ground/","section":"Posts","summary":"A psychological survival horror game that stands out for its haunting atmosphere and unique companion mechanics.","title":"Haunting Ground"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 11 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nFaithful Modern Remake #This title is a respectful and skillful remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, built using the Legend engine but infused with the atmosphere, pacing, and design philosophy of the franchise’s roots. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, it celebrates Lara Croft’s first adventure by retelling her search for the Scion of Atlantis with modernized visuals, smoother mechanics, and a more cohesive narrative.\nExploration and Puzzles #The core of the game lies in its exploration and puzzle-solving, not in flashy combat or constant action. Ancient temples, forgotten tombs, and intricate ruins form the backbone of the experience. Each environment feels like a massive puzzle box waiting to be unlocked, requiring precision jumps, keen observation, and clever manipulation of the environment. The redesigned levels preserve the soul of the 1996 maps while adding new layers of complexity and visual beauty.\nRefined Yet Classic #Lara controls fluidly compared to the original’s grid-based movement, though some people may find the camera and platforming imprecise by today’s standards. Combat remains secondary, with a limited set of enemies and basic lock-on gunplay, but it never overstays its welcome. Instead, the game shines in moments of solitude, when you’re alone in a vast, echoing tomb, solving a mechanism that’s lain dormant for centuries.\nAtmospheric Tomb Adventure #The OST and atmosphere enhance this sense of mystery and adventure. The music subtly shifts between quiet tension and triumphant discovery, perfectly complementing the game’s rhythm of exploration and revelation. Visually, Anniversary still holds up decently on PC, with detailed architecture and strong lighting that make each environment feel alive. Overall, this game succeeds as both a tribute and a refinement. It bridges the gap between the old-school design of the ’90s and the cinematic presentation of the 2000s.\nTimeless Franchise Tribute #For longtime fans, it’s a nostalgic journey reimagined with respect; for newcomers, it’s a beautifully crafted introduction to what Tomb Raider truly meant back in the day, adventure, intelligence, and discovery. This is definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, or if you like similar titles. I remember this blowing my mind when I realized that games could be remade into new versions, and then the RE titles followed suit and nowadays we have a lot of them to play around with.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lara-croft-tomb-raider-anniversary/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a respectful and skillful remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider.","title":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nEpic 16-Bit Warfare #This title is a standout example of how far developers could push the SNES near the end of its lifespan. The game delivers a thrilling mix of precision platforming, intense action, and clever mech-based gameplay. The MC is called Stone, a soldier fighting against the Dark Axis forces in a desperate war for Earth’s survival. While the plot is fairly simple, the atmosphere and presentation make the conflict feel epic, especially for a 16-bit title.\nInnovative Mech Gameplay #What truly sets the game apart is its unique gameplay loop. You pilot various mechs, each with distinct weapons, mobility, and combat styles, from the balanced Nitro unit to the heavy Prometheus or the flight-capable Havoc. Impressively, you can eject from your mech at any time to explore small passages or hijack enemy suits, adding a layer of strategy uncommon in action games of that era. This mechanic keeps gameplay fresh and dynamic, blending exploration and combat seamlessly.\nPolished Action Design #The controls are crisp and responsive, with satisfying weapon feedback and fluid animations. The level design encourages experimentation, rewarding people who learn to use each mech’s strengths effectively. Graphically, the game is stunning, detailed environments, smooth animation, and explosive effects that rival even some early 32-bit titles. The OST complements the action with a gritty, futuristic tone that enhances the immersion.\nChallenging Yet Replayable #It is also notable for its two-player split-screen versus mode, a rare feature that adds considerable replayability, in which I poured a couple of hours into with some friends back in the day. However, the game is challenging, limited continues, tough enemies, and minimal guidance make it demanding even for experienced people. I admit that I could only manage to beat this title while using save-states via emulation, it is sometimes an unbalanced experience.\nAmbitious SNES Classic #Despite its difficulty and limited availability at release, this game has since become a cult classic. It’s one of the most technically and creatively ambitious titles on the SNES, and to this day, it stands as a testament to LucasArts’ innovation and mastery of the 16-bit platform. It is a no-brainer since it is very short, there is little to no excuse not to play this if you enjoy other similar games of this era.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-warriors/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a standout example of how far developers could push the SNES near the end of its lifespan.","title":"Metal Warriors"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nSurprisingly Clever Disney Game #This title is one of those rare licensed games that went far beyond expectations, the game blends lighthearted Disney charm with surprisingly clever gameplay design. Based loosely on the animated TV series of the same name, it sees Goofy and his son Max stranded on Spoonerville Island after pirates kidnap their neighbors Pete and PJ. What follows is a five-stage adventure full of puzzles, exploration, and slapstick humor.\nPuzzle-Action Gameplay #At its core, it plays a lot like a lighter, cooperative take on Zelda ALTTP. You move room to room solving block puzzles, collecting items like keys, grappling hooks, and candles, and tossing barrels or objects to defeat enemies. The mechanics are simple but extremely well-tuned, and the game’s balance between action and puzzle-solving keeps it engaging from start to finish. While Goofy is stronger but slower, Max moves faster but can’t push heavy blocks, a small but effective distinction that adds to the cooperative strategy when playing with a friend.\nCooperative Play Highlights #The two-player mode is where the game shines, coordination between players is essential, one can distract enemies while the other solves puzzles or grabs items, making the experience feel dynamic and social. I played this alone and I highly recommend doing so if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a friend to tag along, the experience is still enjoyable. Even in single-player, the AI and level design hold up well, but there’s something uniquely fun about the shared laughter and mild chaos of local co-op sessions, plus you don\u0026rsquo;t even need the AI, you can go full solo.\nVibrant Presentation, Short Length #Visually, it is vibrant and detailed, capturing the feel of the cartoon with expressive sprites and lush tropical backgrounds. The OST, full of upbeat island tunes and catchy melodies, perfectly matches the lighthearted tone, similar to other Disney titles of the SNES era. Its only real drawback is its short length, with just five stages, most people can finish the game in a couple of hours. Yet, its charm, replay value, and tight design make it one of the most underrated gems of the SNES library. This game proves that even a Disney license can deliver something timeless when handled by a studio that truly understands gameplay.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/goof-troop/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game blends lighthearted Disney charm with surprisingly clever gameplay design.","title":"Goof Troop"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRetro-Inspired 2D Platformer #This title is a lovingly crafted 2D platformer that channels the energy and spirit of the 1990s with remarkable authenticity. It draws clear inspiration from genre greats like Donkey Kong Country and Rayman, but manages to carve out its own charm through sharp design and an endearing presentation. The MC is called Kaze, a brave rabbit who embarks on a quest to save her friend Hogo from a mysterious curse that has corrupted the Crystal Islands. The premise is simple and intentionally retro, setting the stage for a series of challenging, tightly designed levels that feel like a direct homage to the golden era of side-scrolling platformers. I\u0026rsquo;m a little biased since the studio behind this title is from Brazil, but I sincerely think this is one of the best indies that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played.\nFluid, Varied Gameplay #Gameplay is where it truly shines, the controls are precise and responsive, allowing for fluid movement and quick reactions, an essential trait for a game that frequently tests your timing and platforming precision. Each stage introduces new mechanics or obstacles, keeping the pace lively and avoiding repetition. The “Wild Masks” mechanic adds welcome variety, letting you temporarily adopt new animal forms such as a tiger that sprints up walls, a shark that swims swiftly underwater, an eagle that glides through aerial levels, and a lizard that dashes through auto-run sections. These transformations not only diversify the gameplay but also infuse the adventure with a sense of discovery and excitement, as you adapt to new styles of movement and combat.\nVibrant Visuals and Music #Visually, the game is a delight, its hand-drawn pixel art is bursting with color and detail, capturing lush jungles, eerie ruins, and shimmering underwater zones with impressive craftsmanship. Animations are smooth and expressive, giving both Kaze and her enemies personality. The OST complements the visuals perfectly, offering upbeat melodies and atmospheric tunes that shift naturally with each environment. Together, these elements create a sense of warmth and familiarity that’s both nostalgic and fresh, as if you’re playing a lost SNES classic that’s been remade with modern polish.\nRetro Design Challenges #Despite all its strengths, this title isn’t without its flaws, its devotion to retro design means it doesn’t break much new ground; many of its ideas and level structures will feel instantly recognizable to seasoned platformer fans. The game’s difficulty can also be punishing, especially in later levels or bonus challenges, relying on memorization and split-second timing. I admit that I consider myself a platforming veteran but I still struggled trying to play the end-game levels. Some people might find this frustrating, while others will see it as a rewarding callback to the tough-but-fair standards of 90s gaming.\nCraftsmanship and Heart #Ultimately, this title Wild Masks succeeds because of its craftsmanship and heart. It doesn’t try to reinvent the genre, but rather celebrates it with confidence and precision. Every jump, enemy placement, and power-up feels carefully considered, and the game radiates a clear love for the classics that inspired it. For people who grew up on 16-bit adventures, like myself, or anyone craving a polished, challenging platformer with timeless appeal, this game is a hidden gem that deserves attention. This is definitely a must-play if you like platformers to any extent, and obviously if you like the games that inspired this one. I recommend doing 100% since it is a very short and simple title, and it feels like it was made with this intention in mind.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kaze-and-the-wild-masks/","section":"Posts","summary":"A lovingly crafted 2D platformer that channels the energy and spirit of the 1990s with remarkable authenticity.","title":"Kaze and the Wild Masks"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 9 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNon-Linear Exploration Focus #This title is a distinctive entry in the Kirby series that experiments with non-linear exploration, setting it apart from previous Kirby titles. Instead of progressing through a strictly linear set of levels, you navigate a vast, interconnected mirrored world, filled with branching paths, secret areas, and hidden treasures. This design encourages you to explore thoroughly, rewarding curiosity and careful navigation with power-ups and secret collectibles.\nClassic Gameplay, Multiplayer Added #The game retains the classic Kirby formula of inhaling enemies to gain their abilities, offering a wide variety of powers that can be strategically combined to overcome obstacles. The combat is simple but satisfying, and the puzzles, though not overly complex, add a nice layer of variety to the gameplay. A major highlight is the introduction of cooperative multiplayer, which allows up to four players to join in simultaneously, each controlling a different colored Kirby. I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced the multiplayer feature so I can\u0026rsquo;t give much of a valuable opinion on this, I played this entirely alone, and it was still an enjoyable experience.\nCharming Visuals and Sound #Visually, the game is bright, colorful, and full of charm, with detailed sprite work that brings the mirrored world to life. The OST is lively and memorable, perfectly complementing the whimsical, adventurous tone of the game, similar to previous titles of this franchise. On the downside, the open-world structure can sometimes feel a bit aimless compared to the tight, level-based design of other Kirby games, and certain areas can become repetitive during extended play sessions.\nOpen-World Strengths and Weaknesses #It\u0026rsquo;s open-world is it\u0026rsquo;s biggest strength, and also it\u0026rsquo;s biggest weakness, it was not very well implemented, leading you to waste a couple of unnecessary hours lost in the navigation process. Overall, this game is a bold and enjoyable experiment in the series, its combination of open-ended exploration, classic Kirby gameplay, and multiplayer fun makes it a unique and memorable experience for both longtime fans and newcomers alike, offering a refreshing take on the pink puffball’s adventures.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kirby-and-the-amazing-mirror/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title experiments with non-linear exploration, setting it apart from previous Kirby titles.","title":"Kirby \u0026 The Amazing Mirror"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Crime Drama #This title is a third-person, story-driven crime drama set in the fictional city of Empire Bay, a richly detailed world inspired by post-war America from the 1940s to the 1950s. The MC is called Vito Scaletta, a Sicilian-American war veteran who returns home after World War II, only to find himself entangled in the criminal underworld in search of money, power, and belonging. The narrative is the game’s greatest strength. It’s mature, cinematic, and grounded, focusing more on loyalty, betrayal, and family than over-the-top action. Vito’s journey, along with his hot-headed best friend Joe Barbaro, feels authentic and tragic, making the story feel like a playable gangster film.\nAuthentic Worldbuilding Excellence #The dialogue is sharp, the pacing is tight, and the voice acting, especially from Rick Pasqualone as Vito, is top-notch. Visually, it remains impressive for its time. The attention to detail in the cars, fashion, and architecture of Empire Bay captures the era’s mood perfectly, if you are a car enthusiast you\u0026rsquo;ll fall in love with this game solely because of it\u0026rsquo;s driving experience. The licensed soundtrack, featuring artists like Buddy Holly and Dean Martin, adds a ton of personality and helps immerse you in the world. In many ways this title has a similar quality level to the GTA titles, despite it\u0026rsquo;s scale being very small in comparison, and also not having as good of a sandbox, it still retains the world building and mainline plot quality level.\nLinear Yet Powerful #As for the gameplay, however, it definitely shows its limitations. The gunplay is competent but formulaic, and the open world, while beautiful, is surprisingly empty. There are no side missions or meaningful activities beyond the main story, which makes Empire Bay feel more like a backdrop than a living city. Still, the tight structure ensures that the narrative stays focused, avoiding unnecessary filler. Overall, this title stands out for its storytelling, atmosphere, and cinematic presentation rather than its mechanics. It’s a game that values mood and narrative depth over sandbox freedom. This title is a stylish, emotional crime saga that feels like a love letter to classic mob cinema, beautiful, moody, and unforgettable, even if it’s more linear than open-world.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mafia-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A game with richly detailed world inspired by post-war America from the 1940s to the 1950s.","title":"Mafia II"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nChallenging Action-Platformer Revival #This title is an action-platformer that serves as a spiritual successor to Ghosts ’n Goblins. The game challenges you with tight combat, precise platforming, and a high difficulty level that rewards persistence and skill. Its core mechanics of sword combat, armor management, and exploration are solid, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment when progressing through tough levels. I admit that I abused the save-state feature in order to complete and 100% this one, no shame since it is an insanely punishing title, similar to it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor.\nCharming Visuals and Sound #The visual style is charming, with colorful environments, skeletal enemies, and a humorous armor system where Maximo loses his armor after taking damage. It really makes you feel like you are playing a 3D version of the 2D titles from the previous console generations, this shows that you can still retain a consistent art-style despite the technology being used. The game’s presentation adds personality and keeps the action engaging, while the sound design and music complement the old-school arcade feel. The game also encourages replayability due to its challenging nature and strategic item usage, I advise this title is played 100% because of it\u0026rsquo;s short length, despite it stretching it because of it\u0026rsquo;s difficulty level.\nDifficulty and Design Flaws #However, the high difficulty can be punishing, especially for modern people used to frequent checkpoints and forgiving gameplay (easily solved by using save-states). Some camera angles and control quirks occasionally make combat and platforming frustrating, and the level design, while competent, can feel repetitive after extended play. Despite these issues, the challenge and nostalgic design make it appealing to fans of retro-inspired action games. Overall, this game is a rewarding experience for people who enjoy old-school difficulty and precise platforming. It is a standout PS2 title for those seeking a challenging adventure with personality, even if it demands patience and skill to fully appreciate.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/maximo-ghosts-to-glory/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an action-platformer that serves as a spiritual successor to Ghosts \u0026rsquo;n Goblins.","title":"Maximo Ghosts to Glory"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nModern Stealth Revival #This title is a bold attempt to revive the beloved stealth franchise for a modern audience. The MC is called Garrett, a master thief navigating a dark, industrial city rife with corruption, social inequality, and mysterious supernatural forces. The game leans heavily into stealth mechanics, encouraging careful planning, patience, and creative use of gadgets like water arrows, rope arrows, and the trusty blackjack to incapacitate foes without raising alarms. Shadows and light play a critical role, making the environment itself a key part of gameplay strategy.\nMoody, Immersive World #Visually, Thief delivers a moody, immersive world. The city is filled with narrow alleys, towering rooftops, and richly detailed interiors, all bathed in an atmospheric mix of torchlight and fog. Sound design further enhances the tension, with creaking floors, distant guards, and ambient noises creating a constant sense of unease. However, while the setting is impressive, the story falls short compared to earlier entries. Garrett’s motivations are often underdeveloped, and the narrative, though engaging at times, struggles to maintain momentum across missions.\nStealth Gameplay Strengths/Weaknesses #As for the gameplay, the focus on stealth is both a strength and a weakness. Many missions reward careful, methodical play, but some sections feel repetitive, and enemy AI can be inconsistent, sometimes clever and unpredictable, other times easily exploitable. Combat is intentionally weak to reinforce stealth, but this can frustrate people who prefer a more balanced approach.\nFalls Short Overall #This game succeeds in creating a tense, atmospheric stealth experience, but it cannot honor the spirit of the original series. It shines in its environmental design and stealth mechanics, but a thin story and occasional gameplay inconsistencies prevent it from fully reaching its potential. This is not a very good stealth game, and a very very bad Thief title, I\u0026rsquo;m saying this as a fan of stealth games in general, and not as a Thief fan, because despite all the criticism, I\u0026rsquo;ve never played a Thief game before.\nFirst-Hand Fan Verdict #This was my first Thief game, and I knew this was not a good one, though I decided to play it to see for myself. And all people say is true, this is a very bad stealth title, as already said, and it made me want to play the other Thief games, though not because this one is good, but because I keep hearing good things about them so I got very curious. I recommend this one is skipped and that people interested in the series buy and play the re-releases for the modern platforms, and stay away from this one.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/thief/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a bold attempt to revive the beloved stealth franchise for a modern audience.","title":"Thief"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 23 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nModernized Half-Life Rebirth #This title is an extraordinary reimagining of Valve’s 1998 classic Half-Life, brought to life by the dedicated team at Crowbar Collective.

Rebuilt in the Source engine, Black Mesa transforms the familiar environments of the Black Mesa Research Facility into richly detailed, immersive spaces that feel alive and modern without losing the tense, claustrophobic atmosphere that defined the original. Lighting, textures, and sound design have all been dramatically improved, giving the game a sense of realism and scale that Half-Life could only hint at two decades ago.\nRefined Combat Brilliance #Combat feels sharper and more deliberate, thanks to refined weapon handling, smarter enemy placement, and an improved sense of pacing. Classic moments, like the tram ride intro or the frantic struggle to reach the surface, retain their iconic punch, while the new dialogue and expanded NPC interactions add personality and depth to the world. The reimagined Xen chapters, once considered Half-Life’s weakest link, are now one of Black Mesa’s crowning achievements. Vast, colorful alien landscapes, intricate level design, and atmospheric music turn this final act into a stunning showcase of creativity and technical polish.\nPersonal Modding Memories #I have a long story with this game, back when I first heard about this, I hacked my way through the Steam Tools menus in order to enable the necessary SDK to be able to install this. This was due to this game not really being a game at the beginning of it\u0026rsquo;s conception, as already said, this was supposed to be a mod for Half-Life 2, so there was no Steam Store page, you just had to make it work like a mod. Despite all this, it was already a blast when I first played the unfinished version, and later I decided to replay this when I knew the Xen level was already finished.\nDefinitive Remake Achievement #It was so frustrating having a \u0026ldquo;to be continued\u0026rdquo; screen once you reached this part of the game back in the day, but I can safely say that it was worth the wait. Despite minor issues like occasional AI oddities or uneven difficulty spikes, this game stands as both a love letter to the original Half-Life and a testament to what passionate fans can achieve. It’s not just a remake, it’s the definitive way to relive one of the most influential shooters ever made.

The soundtrack is equally memorable, mixing haunting melodies and energetic battle themes that enhance the atmosphere, it retains the same level of quality if previous entries in the franchise. Unlike some of its predecessors, Order of Ecclesia uses a mission-based structure rather than a single sprawling castle, which gives it a more focused pace while still offering secrets and backtracking opportunities.\nRewarding High Difficulty #However, this focus on precision and combat comes with a price, a high difficulty level. Boss fights are punishing, enemies hit hard, and the game demands mastery of its mechanics to progress.

If you are interested in the online experience, at least up until the moment I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, the community still seems to be active and have developed a way to bring back the online multiplayer feature.\nAmbitious Yet Limited #There are community servers which you can connect to and play the emulated version of the game after you go through some hacking to set things up properly. Technically, Outbreak was ambitious but hampered by the limitations of early 2000s online infrastructure. Slow load times, clunky menus, and limited communication options (restricted to preset phrases) made teamwork cumbersome. Yet despite its flaws, the game exuded atmosphere, with detailed environments, tense pacing, and a grim tone that captured the panic and hopelessness of Raccoon City better than many entries in the series.\nCult Classic Legacy #While not a mainstream hit at release, this gmae has since gained a devoted cult following. Fans continue to appreciate its creativity, sense of community, and survival horror authenticity, elements that laid the groundwork for future multiplayer experiments in the Resident Evil franchise. This was one of my favorite games of the PlayStation 2 simply because of it\u0026rsquo;s unique experience, not because of the multiplayer, but because of the amount of different outcomes each level had to offer. This is a very limited mechanic compared to the second entry, but it is still there since you can experience the levels very differently depending on the character that you choose on playing.\n","date":"24 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/resident-evil-outbreak/","section":"Posts","summary":"A bold attempt to bring the classic Resident Evil survival horror formula into the world of online multiplayer.","title":"Resident Evil Outbreak"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nEpic Trilogy Finale #This title marks the conclusion of Crystal Dynamics’ first trilogy with Lara Croft, following Legend and Anniversary. It’s an ambitious attempt to blend the classic spirit of Tomb Raider, exploration, puzzles, and mythological intrigue, with more modern visuals and fluid gameplay. The game opens with a dramatic sequence in Croft Manor, immediately setting a darker and more personal tone. From there, Lara travels across richly detailed locations like the Mediterranean Sea, Thailand, Mexico, and the Arctic, each offering large, interconnected levels filled with secrets.\nStunning Atmospheric Worlds #The environments are stunning for their time, dripping with atmosphere and a sense of scale that few adventure games in 2008 could match. The underwater sections, in particular, highlight the game’s technical achievements with realistic lighting and impressive physics. This was a natural evolution of the franchise that was being influenced by other modern titles of it\u0026rsquo;s era, despite it having big influence in them on a distant past. Gameplay focuses heavily on exploration and environmental puzzles, which often span entire areas and require sharp observation and creative problem-solving.\nExploration Over Combat #Lara’s movement feels agile and more realistic than ever before, with a free-form climbing system that gives you multiple ways to traverse obstacles. However, the controls can sometimes feel finicky, especially during precision jumps or when the camera misbehaves, a lingering issue from earlier games in the series. Combat takes a back seat to exploration. While dual pistols and acrobatics return, enemy encounters are brief and less dynamic than in Legend. Instead, Underworld emphasizes solitude and discovery, which gives the game a meditative tone reminiscent of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, which is a good thing in my opinion, and I enjoyed this style more than the combat-focused one of Legend.\nMythic Narrative Closure #Narratively, the game ties together the trilogy’s loose threads, exploring Lara’s complex relationship with her missing mother and her moral struggle against the villainous Natla. The story delves into Norse mythology, adding an epic scale that feels fitting for Lara’s final journey in this continuity. Despite some technical issues and occasional awkward controls, this Tomb Raider entry remains an atmospheric, challenging, and visually impressive experience. It’s a game that rewards patience and curiosity, offering a mix of beauty, mystery, and adventure, a worthy farewell to the pre-reboot Lara Croft era.\n","date":"24 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/tomb-raider-underworld/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title marks the conclusion of the first trilogy with Lara Croft, following Legend and Anniversary.","title":"Tomb Raider Underworld"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 25 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nLonely Mystical Descent #This title is a hauntingly atmospheric top-down adventure that drops you onto a mysterious island to explore its dark, labyrinthine depths. The game’s minimalist storytelling and lack of guidance create a powerful sense of mystery and discovery, rewarding people who are patient and curious. Its visual style is striking, combining sharp geometric design with moody lighting that perfectly complements the amazing OST. Together, they craft an atmosphere that feels both lonely and mesmerizing.\nBeautiful Yet Punishing #However, Below is as punishing as it is beautiful. Its survival elements, hunger, thirst, temperature, and permadeath, can make progress feel grueling, especially when exploration demands repetition after each death. The sparse explanations of its mechanics often leave you confused, turning intrigue into frustration. While later updates added an “Explore Mode” that softens the difficulty, the game still maintains its slow, deliberate pacing, which won’t appeal to everyone.\nMeditative Mystery Appeal #For those who value mystery, solitude, and the satisfaction of figuring things out on their own, Below is an absorbing and meditative experience. But for people seeking momentum or clear goals, its beauty may feel trapped behind layers of tedium and trial. This title was patched a lot since it\u0026rsquo;s first release, and this is what made me want to come back to it, because as much as I love difficult games, this one was a very unbalanced one, especially on later sections of the game.\nFrustrating but Rewarding #I admit that I used cheat codes in order to finish this, since the first time I played it was insanely frustrating, and this time around, even though it was heavily patched for balancing reasons, it still has some frustrating sections by the end of the journey. Despite all this, this is a very valuable experience to go through if you like titles such as Zelda, even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of similarities, they achieve the same goal: making the player curious enough to explore on it\u0026rsquo;s own and find it\u0026rsquo;s secrets. I just advise a heavy dose of patience because you\u0026rsquo;ll lose some hairs playing this.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/below/","section":"Posts","summary":"A hauntingly atmospheric top-down adventure that drops you onto a mysterious island to explore its depths.","title":"Below"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 25 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nModernized Doom Collection #This title is a remastered and expanded collection that compiles Doom 3, its expansion Resurrection of Evil, a brand-new mini-campaign titled The Lost Mission, and the original Doom and Doom II in one package. Developed by id Software and published by Bethesda, it was designed to reintroduce Doom 3 to a new generation of players while modernizing some of its systems for contemporary hardware. The result is a technically smoother experience that still retains much of the claustrophobic tension and atmospheric horror that defined the 2004 release.\nVisual and Gameplay Updates #Visually, this version improves lighting, texture sharpness, and performance, with better compatibility for newer PCs and even 3D display support. The inclusion of checkpoints, widescreen support, and native gamepad controls makes it more approachable and console-friendly. The infamous flashlight mechanic, once requiring people to switch between weapon and light, was revised so that the flashlight can now be used alongside weapons. This adjustment makes the gameplay flow more naturally but also changes the tone, reducing the feeling of vulnerability that gave the original such a unique sense of dread.\nContent Additions and Tradeoffs #From a content perspective, the package offers a lot of value. The Lost Mission provides several new levels, and the addition of the classic Doom titles creates a compact timeline of the franchise’s evolution. For newcomers, it’s an excellent way to explore Doom’s legacy from its early pixelated roots to its mid-2000s experiment with survival horror. For returning fans, however, the changes might feel mixed. The flashlight tweak, softer lighting, and more generous ammo placement make the experience easier and less suspenseful. The PC version also removes some of the original’s mod and multiplayer features, which disappointed parts of the community.\nPolished Yet Dated Experience #While this version isn’t a radical overhaul, it does provide a polished and stable version of original version that runs flawlessly on modern systems. The atmosphere, monster designs, and sound effects still create a thick, eerie tension that few shooters replicate today. Yet, by the standards at the time, the linear level design and repetitive enemy encounters were already showing their age. Overall, this game is a worthwhile purchase for those who want a convenient, optimized way to experience Doom 3 and its companions. It stands as a solid, if somewhat softened, reminder of id Software’s attempt to blend action and horror within the Doom universe.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/doom-3-bfg-edition/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a remastered and expanded collection that compiles all Doom 3 extra contents.","title":"Doom 3 BFG Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 40 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRevolutionary 16-Bit Epic #This title is widely regarded as one of the crowning achievements of the 16-bit era and a landmark in the history of RPGs. It pushed the SNES hardware to its limits, delivering a world that felt vast, alive, and emotionally resonant. Unlike many RPGs of its time, this one does not center on a single protagonist, instead, it presents a sprawling ensemble cast, each character with a distinct personality, backstory, and role in the story. This approach allows the game to explore complex themes such as loss, oppression, redemption, and the cost of ambition, creating a narrative depth rarely seen in games of the era.\nRich World and Villains #The world of this title blends classic fantasy with steampunk aesthetics, filled with airships, industrial landscapes, and magical relics that hint at a lost past. You experience a journey across diverse environments, from bustling cities to desolate wastelands, encountering a variety of factions, each with its own motivations and struggles. The villains, particularly the enigmatic Kefka, are crafted with theatrical flair, making him one of the most memorable antagonists in gaming history due to his chaotic nature and descent into godlike madness.\nRefined Combat Systems #As for the gameplay, it refines the Active Time Battle system introduced in previous entries, providing fluid, strategic combat while giving you the freedom to develop their party through Espers and magicite. These systems allow for extensive customization of abilities and magic, ensuring that each playthrough can feel unique. Outside combat, exploration and interaction are richly rewarding, with hidden treasures, side quests, and secrets that encourage players to fully immerse themselves in the world. one of the best side-quests is the Legendary Dragon ones, I highly recommend not skipping this, they are a series of very difficulty and unique boss battles, which are a tradition of the FF franchise.\nIconic Visuals and Music #Visually, the game makes remarkable use of the SNES capabilities. Sprites are expressive, environments are detailed, and even minor animations convey personality and emotion. The soundtrack is nothing short of legendary, ranging from tender and melancholic melodies to epic orchestral pieces, each track perfectly complementing the narrative moments. Everything that has the Nobuo Uematsu touch is going to be the best gaming music you can experience, hands down. Iconic compositions like “Terra’s Theme,” “Aria di Mezzo Carattere,” and “Dancing Mad” remain celebrated decades later for their emotional power and technical sophistication.\nEmotional Narrative Depth #Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, Final Fantasy VI’s enduring appeal lies in its emotional resonance. Its story doesn’t shy away from tragedy or the consequences of its characters’ choices, creating a sense of weight and significance in every action. The game’s structure allows you to experience a dramatic tonal shift midway, giving a sense of scale and progression that was revolutionary for its time. Even today, this game stands as a benchmark for narrative-driven RPGs.\nTimeless RPG Masterpiece #Its combination of deep characterization, compelling storytelling, inventive gameplay mechanics, and unforgettable music ensures its place not only in the history of the Final Fantasy series but also in the broader history of video games. It remains a timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire developers, captivate players, and demonstrate the emotional and artistic potential of the medium. This is one of the best games of all time, I can\u0026rsquo;t decide if this is my favorite of the series, or FFVII (I have more nostalgic feelings towards this one), and it is undoubtedly a must-play if you like RPGs any extent, take advantage of the modern re-releases an don\u0026rsquo;t think twice. If you need a little push, I advise watching the Angry Video-Game Nerd video on this, that was what made me decide finally play this.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/final-fantasy-vi/","section":"Posts","summary":"A widely regarded as one of the crowning achievements of the 16-bit era and a landmark in the history of RPGs.","title":"Final Fantasy VI"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nAtmospheric Dystopian Journey #This title is a dark, atmospheric puzzle-platformer developed by same studio behind the acclaimed Limbo. You take control of a unamed young boy navigating a dystopian and oppressive world, filled with shadowy figures, strange machinery, and environmental hazards. The game is presented in a 2.5D side-scrolling perspective, with meticulously crafted visuals and lighting that convey mood, tension, and storytelling without a single line of dialogue. Every detail, from the flickering lights to the distant sounds of unseen dangers, contributes to an immersive, haunting experience.\nSubtle Puzzles, Deep Story #The puzzles are subtle yet clever, often requiring you to manipulate objects, avoid detection, or use physics in unexpected ways. The game gradually escalates the sense of danger, introducing new mechanics and threats that keep the you constantly alert. Unlike many games, it communicates its story entirely through its environment, animations, and occasional surreal sequences, leaving much open to interpretation. This minimalist approach makes each discovery feel impactful and emotionally resonant.\nHaunting Artistic Mastery #A lot of people have praised it for its remarkable art direction, tightly designed gameplay, and emotional depth. Its combination of suspense, subtle horror, and moments of quiet introspection has been described as both haunting and thought-provoking. Many have highlighted how the game expands on the themes of its predecessor Limbo, offering a richer narrative and more nuanced atmosphere. While some note that the core gameplay is simple and the experience relatively short, the tension, visual storytelling, and striking ending leave a lasting impression.\nEmotional Puzzle-Platform Art #Overall, this game stands out as a masterful example of video games as art. Its blend of gameplay, environmental storytelling, and evocative design creates an experience that lingers in the mind long after the final scene. It is a game that challenges you not only with puzzles but also with emotions, making it one of the most memorable and acclaimed puzzle-platformers of its generation.

The game tells the story of a boy and his quirky companions, a giraffe with a helicopter tongue and a pet rock, as they embark on a bizarre quest to stop an evil villain from turning people, including the protagonist’s father, into hot dogs. From the very beginning, it’s clear that the game doesn’t take itself qtoo seriously. Its hand-drawn art style, full of bright colors and cartoonish charm, sets the stage for a world that feels both ridiculous and irresistibly fun.\nFun, Accessible Gameplay #The gameplay blends simple combat, platforming, and light RPG elements. You’ll slash enemies, jump across floating islands, and collect cupcakes and stickers as you progress through a series of small, story-driven worlds. The controls are tight and responsive. It’s approachable and friendly to people of all ages, offering a steady balance of action and humor that’s easy to pick up but hard to dislike.\nCharming Yet Simple #However, the game’s simplicity is also its biggest drawback. While its core mechanics are solid, they don’t evolve much over time, and some people may find the level design repetitive after a few hours. Combat, though fast-paced and flashy, can feel shallow compared to more complex platformers, and the story’s pacing sometimes slows down with fetch quests or reused environments. Still, the sheer charm of its characters and world keeps things engaging, helped along by a silly, heartfelt script that never fails to raise a smile. Overall, this game is a joyful, imaginative adventure that captures the spirit of childhood play.\nLighthearted Joyful Experience #It might not challenge seasoned platforming veterans, but its warmth, humor, and creativity make it an endearing experience for anyone looking for a light, feel-good game. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that make you laugh. Particularly I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity is a bad thing, not all needs to have over-the-top mechanics and features to be enjoyable, Nintendo titles are big examples of this. And as I do on all recommendations, when it comes to simpler games like this one, I highly recommend this is a 100% run, since it is so short and simple that it deserves to be played to the fullest in order to experience it properly.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-adventure-pals/","section":"Posts","summary":"A delightfully strange and heartwarming action-platformer that thrives on its sense of humor and creativity.","title":"The Adventure Pals"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBold 3D Reimagining #This title is a bold and innovative reimagining of the series. Rather than sticking to the traditional top-down grid-based gameplay of its predecessors, the game ventures into fully 3D environments, a significant shift that transforms how puzzles, combat, and exploration work. The story mode places Bomberman on a quest to stop the evil Altair and his minions, featuring multiple themed worlds filled with intricate puzzles, secrets, and platforming challenges.\nNew Mechanics and Depth #The transition to 3D allows for new gameplay mechanics, like the ability to pick up and throw bombs, stack them, or use their explosions to launch Bomberman into the air, an essential skill for reaching hidden areas and solving environmental puzzles. This design encourages experimentation and rewards careful timing and spatial awareness. Each stage is packed with collectible items and hidden gold cards that unlock extra content, adding depth and replay value.\nTactical 3D Multiplayer #The multiplayer mode, while slower and less frantic than the classic SNES versions, introduces spherical arenas and vertical layouts that make matches feel more tactical. You must think in three dimensions, planning bomb placements and escape routes with greater precision. It was quite a blast back in the day since very few people managed to master the 3D mechanics of the transition, when compared to the classics, especially when it comes to the fast-paced multiplayer matches.\nColorful N64 Adventure #Visually, it captures the colorful charm of the series, with expressive characters, varied environments, and a distinctive polygonal style that defines late-’90s Nintendo 64 aesthetics. The OST is upbeat and atmospheric, matching each world’s tone perfectly. Though some fans missed the fast-paced simplicity of earlier entries, this game stands out as one of the franchise’s most creative and ambitious installments.

It transforms Bomberman’s familiar bomb-based gameplay into a more expansive adventure — one that feels closer to Super Mario 64 or Crash Bandicoot than the grid-based arenas fans were used to. And despite me being a fan of the original formula, I also forever thought about playing a more traditional Bomberman, such as this one, and despite it\u0026rsquo;s flaws, I loved the the style.\nAmbitious Planet-Spanning Story #The story is surprisingly ambitious for a Bomberman game. You play as the heroic Bomberman, who sets off across several planets to rescue Princess Millian and recover a stolen data disk containing critical information. This intergalactic journey takes you through a variety of colorful worlds, from snowy landscapes and lava-filled caverns to futuristic bases, each packed with enemies, hazards, and secrets to uncover.\nPlatforming and Gadgets #Gameplay revolves around precise platforming, bomb-throwing combat, and light puzzle-solving. You gains access to new moves and gadgets, like a jetpack and underwater gear, which keep the action varied and lively. Though you can only access these gadgets during some predetermined sections of the game, specifically, you play through some levels using them, from start to finish. The controls are responsive, though the fixed camera can occasionally make platforming tricky.\nSingle-Player Focused Design #Unlike most Bomberman titles, this one completely omits the trademark multiplayer mode, which disappointed some fans but allowed the developers to focus on crafting a cohesive, story-driven experience. Particularly I never minded it not having a MP mode, I highly value a polished single-player campaign over one. One of the standout aspects of this is its OST. The energetic blend of electronic, drum ‘n’ bass, and ambient tracks perfectly complements the game’s fast-paced, futuristic vibe.\nUnderrated N64 Experiment #While the game can feel repetitive in its level structure and lacks the depth of other 3D platformers of its era, its charm, music, and smooth gameplay give it a distinct identity within the series. This game may not be the definitive Bomberman experience, but it’s an underrated gem, a creative and confident experiment that still stands out in the N64 library for its unique mix of action and style. I highly recommend not skipping this one if you are a like of 3D platformers to any extent, despite it\u0026rsquo;s short length and levels, it is still a very enjoyable experience.\n","date":"22 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bomberman-hero/","section":"Posts","summary":"A step away from the franchise\u0026rsquo;s multiplayer formula, venturing into full 3D single-player platforming territory.","title":"Bomberman Hero"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 50 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Masterpiece of Art #This title is one of those rare games that manages to be both a thrilling action experience and a profound work of art. Developed under the eccentric and visionary direction of Yoko Taro, it combines stylish, high-speed combat with a layered narrative that explores what it means to be human, through the eyes of androids and machines long after humanity has vanished. I knew this was one of the highly praised titles of all time, but I thought this was because of how exotic it was, not to mention it was part of a franchise which I had never heard of. But after playing this and experiencing almost all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents, I can safely say this is absolutely one of the best games of all time.\nA Story Beyond War #Set thousands of years in the future, the story follows combat androids 2B, 9S, and later A2, as they fight to reclaim Earth from alien-created machines. What begins as a seemingly straightforward war between androids and robots slowly unravels into a philosophical and emotional journey filled with existential questions, moral ambiguity, and heartbreak. And for me this is where this game shines, I think it\u0026rsquo;s biggest strength is it\u0026rsquo;s story and the meaning behind it. And I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about some cliche vangeance plot, or some convoluted story with a lot of plot-twists, this is genuinely one of the best stories you can find on modern videogames.\nRoutes, Endings, Gameplay #Each of the game’s multiple main routes (A through E) reveals new perspectives and hidden truths, turning the act of replaying into a vital part of the storytelling rather than simple repetition. The game also has a ton of secret endings, which are mostly meme endings, you\u0026rsquo;ll for sure experience some of them without even knowing. The combat is fast, fluid, and satisfying, allowing you to chain together sword slashes, ranged attacks, and acrobatics with ease. It also constantly experiments with gameplay perspective, shifting from 3D hack-and-slash to 2D platforming or even top-down bullet-hell segments, often within the same mission.\nWorld and Atmosphere #These transitions feel seamless and serve both mechanical and narrative purposes, keeping you constantly engaged. Visually, the game embraces a desolate beauty, ruined cities overrun by nature, hauntingly empty deserts, and broken amusement parks filled with lifeless machines that somehow evoke emotion. The minimalist art direction is elevated by an extraordinary OST, whose music shifts between ethereal vocals and driving battle themes, perfectly capturing the game’s emotional tone.\nEmotional, Philosophical Impact #Where this game truly stands out is in its willingness to challenge you emotionally and intellectually. It questions purpose, consciousness, and the nature of life itself, all through the lens of characters who are, ironically, not human. The final hours, and especially the ending sequence, are among the most memorable and impactful in gaming history. This game is a rare masterpiece that transcends genres. It’s not just a game you play, it’s one you feel, think about, and remember long after the credits roll.

The game continues the series’ signature formula of maze-based action, where you strategically place bombs to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies, and outsmart opponents.\nCharming Story Structure #The story mode, while simple, adds charm and structure to the explosive fun. You are captured by the sinister “Five Dastardly Bombers,” a group of villains who each rule their own themed stage. Each level introduces unique environmental hazards and enemy patterns, keeping the gameplay varied. The boss battles, against the Dastardly Bombers themselves, stand out for their creativity, requiring both quick reflexes and smart bomb placement.\nIconic Multiplayer Chaos #Where it truly shines, though, is in its multiplayer mode. Supporting up to four players with the SNES Multitap, it’s an absolute blast of chaotic strategy and quick thinking. Every match feels different, with the simple mechanics allowing for deep tactical play, trapping friends, predicting movements, and making split-second escapes. The balance between luck, skill, and chaos makes it endlessly replayable, and it’s still one of the most beloved party games of its time.\nColorful SNES Presentation #Visually, the game is bright and colorful, with clean sprites and expressive animations that give personality to both Bomberman and his foes. The OST is equally memorable similar to other entries in the series, full of energetic tunes that perfectly match the game’s fast-paced tension.\nPolished Timeless Formula #Though it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, this game refines it to near perfection.

Each stage feels carefully designed, encouraging both quick thinking and tactical bomb placement. The introduction of the Charabom system, which allows you to ride animal-like companions that grant special abilities, adds variety and depth, offering new ways to approach puzzles and combat alike.\nTimeless Multiplayer Chaos #And you are even able to bring them into bossfights, making these encounters much easier overall. Where it truly shines, however, is in its multiplayer mode. Up to four players can battle across a wide selection of colorful, hazard-filled arenas that keep every match unpredictable.

This premise quickly expands into a deeply layered story that blends science fiction, fantasy, and philosophical reflection on the consequences of human choices.\nVivid Worlds and Music #The game’s world is stunningly realized for its time, boasting vibrant pre-rendered backgrounds and expressive character designs that give each location, from tropical islands to eerie ruins, a distinct personality. The OST is often hailed as one of the finest in video game history, weaving Celtic, tropical, and melancholy melodies into a soundscape that perfectly complements the game’s dreamlike tone.\nUnique Combat and Cast #Gameplay-wise, it departs from standard JRPG conventions. Its stamina-based combat system encourages fluid strategy, rewarding rhythm and balance rather than raw grinding. The vast roster of over 40 recruitable characters may overwhelm some people, but it showcases an impressive range of personalities and playstyles. You don\u0026rsquo;t really need to interact with all of them, but I highly recommend doing so, their side-quests are what makes this game shine.

The gameplay remains faithful to the series’ roots: precise jumps, crate-smashing, and collecting crystals and gems across themed worlds. The mix of forward-scrolling 3D-style levels and classic side-scrolling stages keeps things fresh, and the addition of special stages, like jetpack or surfboard segments, adds variety and challenge.\nBalanced Challenge \u0026amp; Polish #SImilar to other GBA Crash, this feels like playing the side-scrolling levels of the regular PlayStation 3D Crash, and with occasional alternative levels. The difficulty is well balanced, starting accessible and ramping up to satisfy veterans of the series. Replayability is strong, thanks to hidden collectibles and time trials that encourage mastery of each stage. On the technical side, N-Tranced shines: the visuals are vibrant and fluid, and the music, while compressed, captures the upbeat Crash vibe.\nStandout Handheld Platformer #Overall, this game is a standout GBA platformer that manages to feel authentically “Crash” despite the hardware constraints. It’s fast, challenging, and rewarding, a must-play for fans of the this mascot or anyone who loves well-crafted handheld platformers. I highly encourage doing 100% which is similarly satisfying when compared to other similar simpler titles, with hidden levels and secrets to make you invest a little more time into this title before putting it down.\n","date":"21 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/crash-bandicoot-2-n-tranced/","section":"Posts","summary":"An impressive continuation of The Huge Adventure and one of the strongest 2D interpretations of the franchise.","title":"Crash Bandicoot 2 N-Tranced"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDark Fantasy Foundations #This title is a dark fantasy FPS that builds upon the foundation laid by Doom while carving out its own identity through atmosphere, setting, and mechanics. Using a modified version of the Doom engine, the game trades science fiction for grim medieval fantasy, plunging players into a cursed world filled with twisted architecture, sinister catacombs, and demonic sorcerers.\nCorvus and Mystic Arsenal #The MC is called Corvus, an elven hero rebelling against the evil Serpent Riders who have corrupted the realm. The game’s arsenal replaces shotguns and rockets with mystical weapons, like the ethereal crossbow, the Hellstaff, and the Phoenix Rod, each with satisfying impact and variety. Power-ups like the Tome of Power amplify your attacks in spectacular ways, and items such as wings of wrath or morph ovum add a touch of playful experimentation to the brutal action.\nInnovative Early Mechanics #What really sets Heretic apart is its depth for its time. It introduced an inventory system, allowing you to strategically manage consumable items, and featured vertical aiming, something rare in early shooters. And despite this mechanic being a very common thing today, this was revolutionary at the time. The levels are cleverly designed, filled with secrets, traps, and atmospheric lighting that enhance the sense of dread and discovery. The haunting OST and ambient effects further reinforce the dark, oppressive tone of the game’s world.\nA Gothic FPS Classic #While it doesn’t stray far from Doom’s core formula, this game refines and expands it, offering a fresh twist that blends frantic combat with gothic fantasy. Decades later, it remains a cult classic and a milestone in the evolution of FPSs, remembered fondly for its imaginative world, creative weaponry, and early experiments in gameplay complexity. This is a must-play if you are a fan of shooters to any extent, there is no excuse not to play this since there are so many modern re-releases which bundle Heretic and Hexen titles together. Not to mention the amazing modding community which can enhance the experience with a lot of QOL implementations.\n","date":"21 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/heretic/","section":"Posts","summary":"A dark fantasy FPS that builds upon the foundation laid by Doom while carving out its own identity.","title":"Heretic"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Wordless Emotional Journey #This title is an extraordinary and deeply moving experience, renowned for crafting games that evoke emotion over traditional gameplay mechanics. You control a mysterious robed traveler in a vast, sun-swept desert, on a pilgrimage toward a distant, glowing mountain. The game’s narrative is entirely wordless, there’s no dialogue, no text, just the environments, the music, and subtle interactions to tell the story. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t really knew how to interpret this game since everybody was telling me this is a very personal game, and to sum it up, in my opinion, this game is one that you feel it instead of understanding it.\nBeauty Through Simplicity #What sets this one apart is its ability to create emotional resonance through simplicity. The sweeping landscapes, from shifting dunes to ancient ruins, are visually stunning, and every area feels carefully crafted to convey a sense of awe and wonder. The musical score, dynamically changing with your actions, heightens every moment, making the world feel alive and responsive. It has some occasional lightweight puzzles here and there just to make things interesting, not to mention some unique and exotic platforming sections.\nUnique Wordless Multiplayer #A, by far, the most unique aspect of the game is its multiplayer component. You may encounter other people on the same path, but communication is limited to musical chimes. This fosters a rare, wordless form of connection that can feel surprisingly profound, emphasizing cooperation and companionship without ever breaking immersion.\nLasting Emotional Impact #Although the game is short, typically taking only two to three hours to complete, the emotional impact is immense. Themes of struggle, hope, and transcendence are woven seamlessly into gameplay and environment, leaving a lasting impression long after the final scene. Journey is less a traditional game and more an interactive piece of art, proving that video games can be a powerful medium for emotional storytelling. If you are into these kinds of unique, exotic and alternative approaches, this one is definitely one of the best you can find, especially if you also think that videogame are art.\n","date":"21 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/journey/","section":"Posts","summary":"A deeply moving experience, renowned for crafting games that evoke emotion over traditional gameplay mechanics.","title":"Journey"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDual Roman Perspectives #This title is an ambitious action-adventure game by Capcom that combines intense gladiatorial combat with stealth and puzzle-solving elements. Set during the aftermath of Julius Caesar\u0026rsquo;s assassination, you alternate between two MCs, Agrippa, a gladiator trying to clear his father’s name, and Octavianus, who uses stealth to uncover the conspiracy behind the political turmoil. This dual gameplay offers a unique perspective on Roman history, blending visceral combat with investigative exploration.\nCombat vs. Stealth #Agrippa’s segments are the highlight, featuring brutal melee combat where weapon variety, durability, and crowd reactions add depth. The game rewards stylish and crowd-pleasing moves, enhancing the gladiatorial atmosphere. In contrast, Octavianus’s stealth sections focus on sneaking through Roman streets and solving environmental puzzles, though these parts can feel slower and less refined compared to the action-heavy sequences.\nStrong Pacing and Style #I consider the pacing of this game to be one of the best that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, due to the balanced frequency that you alternate between characters. The story is engaging and presented through cinematic cutscenes, offering a fresh take on historical events. The visual design mixes realistic environments with stylized characters, creating a distinct, though sometimes inconsistent, aesthetic. Voice acting and translation occasionally feel awkward, but the narrative remains compelling enough to carry you through both the combat and stealth portions of the game.\nA Distinctive PS2 Gem #Overall, this game received generally favorable reviews for its inventive blend of gameplay styles and its depiction of ancient Rome. While the stealth missions are less polished, the gripping combat, creative mechanics, and intriguing story make it a memorable and distinctive PS2 title. I consider this one of the best titles of it\u0026rsquo;s platform because of my nostalgic feeling towards it, but after I replayed it not too long ago, I realized it is indeed a very good title.

Reading subtle facial cues and body language during interrogations is central to the gameplay, blending intuition and observation in a way few games have managed since. The result is an experience that feels closer to an interactive film noir than a traditional open-world game.\nDistinctive Crime Drama #Though some people may find its slower pace and repetitive case structure less exciting compared to other Rockstar titles, the game’s authenticity, atmosphere, and cinematic storytelling make it stand out. From its smoky jazz soundtrack to its morally complex narrative, this game remains one of the most ambitious and distinctive crime dramas ever made in gaming.\n","date":"20 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/la-noire/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a captivating detective adventure, set in a stunningly detailed recreation of 1947 Los Angeles.","title":"L.A.

Serving as a direct sequel to Super Metroid, MC is yet again Samus after she becomes infected by the mysterious X Parasite, forcing her to rely on a new, biologically altered Power Suit. The result is a more vulnerable version of the iconic bounty hunter, which adds a fresh layer of tension to the gameplay.\nLinear but Purposeful #The game’s structure is notably more linear than its predecessors, guiding you through specific objectives across the labyrinthine corridors of the Biologic Space Laboratories station. While this design sacrifices some of the freeform exploration that defined earlier Metroid games, it replaces it with a stronger sense of narrative momentum and purpose. Despite it being more linear when compared to other entries in the series, it is as satisfying as any other, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get myself turned down by this in any way.\nAtmospheric Sector Exploration #Each sector feels distinct, with cleverly designed layouts that reward backtracking and curiosity once new abilities are unlocked. What truly elevates the game is its mood, the sterile, almost claustrophobic setting and unsettling soundtrack create a palpable sense of dread. Especially when the SA-X, a terrifying clone of Samus, stalks the you through the station. These encounters are rare but unforgettable, turning moments of exploration into heart-pounding survival.\nFocused Cinematic Masterpiece #With tight controls, beautiful pixel art, and a cinematic story that adds emotional depth to Samus as a character, this game stands as both a technical showcase for the GBA and a bold narrative step for the series. It may be more guided than Super Metroid, but it delivers an equally memorable, more focused experience that still holds up remarkably well today.

Armed with nothing but a camcorder, Miles must navigate blood-soaked corridors, avoid deranged inmates, and uncover the horrific truth lurking within the facility.\nVulnerable Survival Tension #The game’s most distinctive feature is its commitment to vulnerability, there are no weapons, no combat, and no way to fight back. Instead, survival depends on running, hiding, and conserving battery power for the camcorder’s night vision, which adds a chilling green tint to every shadowy encounter. The sound design amplifies the terror, with distant screams, echoing footsteps, and heavy breathing pulling players deeper into the asylum’s suffocating atmosphere.\nRelentless Atmospheric Terror #Visually, this game delivers claustrophobic environments dripping with decay and dread, enhanced by realistic lighting that makes every flickering bulb a source of anxiety. While some of its scares rely heavily on repetition and jump shocks, the sheer intensity of its pacing and the oppressive tone sustain the fear throughout.

The game’s highlight is its sniping system, bullet drop, wind resistance, and breath control all factor into each shot, creating a rewarding and tense experience. The X-Ray Kill Cam, showing bullets tearing through enemy bodies in slow motion, adds a unique cinematic flair that became the series’ signature.\nAging Design Issues #However, the game shows its age in several areas, levels are mostly linear, limiting your freedom, and the AI can feel inconsistent, sometimes spotting you unrealistically or failing to react at all. Stealth sections outside of sniping scenarios tend to be clunky, and the visuals, while atmospheric, are dated compared to other 2012 releases. Though I still recommend going stealth on this title since this is really how this game was planned to be played in the first place, not to mention it is more fun using this approach.\nStill Worth Playing #Despite its flaws, this game remains enjoyable for those who appreciate patience and precision over fast-paced action. It’s a solid niche experience, not a technical masterpiece, but a satisfying sniping simulator that rewards methodical play. This was the first title of many when it comes to this franchise, despite it having released titles previous to this one.

The HD visuals breathe new life into its distinctive cel-shaded art style, making the ocean and islands more vibrant and expressive than ever before. I highly recommend playing this version instead of the original one, and this is a rare things for me to say, I tend to stick to the originals, but this remaster is simply too good not to play, in every single way.\nTimeless World \u0026amp; Upgrades #The game’s world feels timeless, filled with charm, personality, and a sense of adventure that few others in the series match. The story remains heartfelt and whimsical, supported by memorable characters and a beautifully composed OST that enhances every voyage across the Great Sea. This version improves on the original with smoother performance and several QOL upgrades, such as the Swift Sail for faster travel, streamlined inventory management, and enhanced use of the Wii U GamePad for maps and item control.\nRefined Yet Imperfect #These changes make exploration far more enjoyable and reduce some of the pacing issues of the 2003 release. However, a few elements still show their age, certain quests, especially toward the end, can feel repetitive or slow, and the sailing, while atmospheric, may test the patience of people seeking constant action. Despite these small flaws, this game remains one of the most charming and emotionally resonant adventures in the Zelda series. It’s both a faithful homage to the original and the best way to experience its magic today.\nEssential Zelda Adventure #This is a must-play if you like this franchise to any extent, it\u0026rsquo;s sense of adventure is the same as any other entry in the series, some people may get themselves fooled by the nature of the sailing mechanic, thinking if would limit the exploration and world-building, but it is quite the opposite, it is a very welcome addition to the varied mechanics the Zelda developers tend to be inclined to implement.

From the opening moments, the game bursts with personality, lush jungles, crumbling temples, and explosive minecart rides create a world that feels alive and demanding in equal measure. The 3D visuals add surprising depth to each environment, making the layered backgrounds and foregrounds more dynamic and visually engaging than ever before on a portable console.\nImproved Button Controls #One of the biggest improvements over the Wii version is the control scheme, the 3DS release removes the motion controls entirely, opting for traditional button inputs instead, and this is a very big deal if you, like me, are not a fan of motion controls. This change immediately makes the gameplay feel tighter and more responsive, especially in a title that relies so heavily on precision platforming. You can now roll, ground pound, and blow through obstacles with satisfying accuracy, which enhances the flow of each level.\nChallenging Yet Accessible #The game’s difficulty remains challenging, but it’s now easier to focus on timing and execution rather than fighting the controls. To make the experience more welcoming for newcomers, it introduces a “New Mode,” which grants Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong extra hearts and provides access to helpful items sold by Cranky Kong. This mode softens some of the game’s notorious difficulty spikes while keeping the core platforming intact for veterans who prefer a real test of skill. Particularly I never played using this mode, but I thought about using it sometimes because even though I consider myself a veteran when it comes to platforming games, I still struggled to beat and 100% this title.\nNew Levels, Trade-offs #Additionally, this version features eight brand-new levels in the “Cloud Gateway” world, offering clever twists and inventive platforming sections that further extend the game’s longevity. There are, however, a few trade-offs. The game’s frame rate is capped at around 30 FPS, which makes animations a bit less fluid and can occasionally affect precision during fast-paced sequences. The smaller 3DS screen also means that certain background elements or hazards can blend together, especially in busier levels, making it harder to judge distances. Still, these are minor issues in an otherwise polished and ambitious handheld port.\nA Must-Play Platformer #Overall, this game stands as one of the finest platformers available on the 3DS. It combines Retro Studios’ signature craftsmanship with the portability and accessibility of Nintendo’s beloved handheld. Its satisfying difficulty curve, tight controls, and rich presentation make it a joy to revisit. Despite a few technical compromises, the game’s spirit remains intact, offering a thrilling, challenging, and deeply rewarding journey through Donkey Kong’s world.

The story follows him on a journey to save the world from eternal darkness after the sun mysteriously vanishes, leading him through mythological realms filled with danger, betrayal, and emotional turmoil.\nStunning Handheld Presentation #For a handheld game, it delivers a remarkable presentation, the visuals push the PSP to its limits, featuring richly detailed environments, cinematic camera angles, and fluid animations that rival its PlayStation 2 predecessors. This was one of the most demanding titles for the platform, especially when it comes to the balancing between performance and battery life. The combat system remains faithful to the series’ core, fast-paced, visceral, and deeply satisfying.\nFaithful, Impactful Combat #Magic abilities and brutal finishing moves add variety, while the game’s boss fights stand out as both challenging and spectacular, so more of the same and if you already liked the previous titles, there is no excuse not to like this one too.

The game begins with Ico’s escape from confinement, but it quickly becomes clear that his journey is about more than just physical freedom. Along the way, he encounters Yorda, a mysterious girl trapped in the castle, and the gameplay revolves around guiding her safely through puzzles and dangerous environments.\nWordless Storytelling Design #The partnership between Ico and Yorda is central to the experience, creating a wordless narrative driven entirely by player interaction and environmental storytelling. It’s design is striking in its simplicity, there is almost no HUD, dialogue is sparse, and enemies are minimal, allowing you to focus entirely on exploration, puzzle-solving, and the growing emotional connection between the characters. The architecture of the castle, with its towering walls, narrow bridges, and vast empty halls, conveys a haunting sense of isolation, yet the presence of Yorda adds warmth and urgency to every step.\nAtmosphere and Teamwork #The puzzles often require teamwork, reinforcing the bond between Ico and Yorda while providing gentle but satisfying challenges. Visually, ICO is ethereal, with soft lighting, misty landscapes, and a muted color palette that enhances the sense of melancholy and wonder. The OST complements this atmosphere perfectly, with quiet, haunting melodies that evoke a sense of timelessness and introspection. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, this game achieves a profound emotional resonance, leaving you with a lingering sense of beauty and poignancy.\nA Timeless Classic #This is most definitely one of the best games of all time, and a must-play if you consider video-games to be art to any extent. Some may say this title shares it\u0026rsquo;s world with Shadow of the Colossus, not just because of the team behind the development, but also because of a lot of similarities that they share. This is what drove me to play this title in the first place since I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of SOTN and I there is very little content related to it\u0026rsquo;s universe as of now.

The fully 3D environments and free camera control felt like a natural modernization of the franchise, offering greater freedom and immersion compared to the earlier games’ cinematic but restrictive design.\nCharacters and Presentation #And while I admit I really liked the characters overall, in terms of personality and gameplay, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really any reason to go in-depth with any of them. You can simply choose the one you liked the most and focus on making that one stronger, particularly I really liked Akane since I enjoy playing with nimble characters in general.

However, Dawn of Dreams was not without flaws, the story, while expansive, suffered from uneven pacing and occasionally clunky dialogue that weakened its emotional impact.\nDifficulty and Repetition #Some people criticized the game for reusing enemies and assets from earlier titles, and the difficulty curve could be inconsistent, certain battles felt dragged out or overly punishing, while others were trivialized by abundant healing items. The previous titles had some spongy enemies and very long battles, but since this one introduced a lot of RPG mechanics, this escalated a lot, some fights are really tiring to go through, and some sections are unnecessarily difficult.\nUnderrated Yet Influential #Despite these issues, this game remains an underappreciated gem in Capcom’s library. It pushed the series toward deeper mechanics and richer gameplay, even if it sacrificed some of the dark atmosphere and tight storytelling that defined its predecessors.

The MC this time is called Flint, a young adventurer seeking revenge against the villainous pirate Mephisto, who becomes entangled in a larger plot involving a corrupt baron, enchanted keys, and a scheme to control the world through mechanical puppets.\nCombat and Exploration #Gameplay revolves around real-time sword combat, exploration, and intricate puzzle-solving. Many dungeons feature clever mechanisms and platforming challenges that recall the spirit of the original Alundra, though the 3D camera and somewhat stiff controls can make precision moments frustrating.

The OST, composed by Dominic Ninmark, is one of the best in gaming history, I consider it to be to the same level of classics such as SNES/PlayStation Mega Man X titles, and this says a lot.\nA Polished Tribute #A lot of people have praised the game for its tight controls, smooth movement, and the satisfaction of mastering its grappling hook mechanics. Overall, this game is a solid tribute to classic 2D platformers. Its refined mechanics, engaging gameplay, and nostalgic presentation make it a standout title for fans of the genre, even if it doesn’t introduce radically new concepts. I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I\u0026rsquo;m a hard-core Mega Man fan, but I simply cannot praise this game enough, it is one of the best ones I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, so much so that I played and replayed it three times in a row, just so that I could enjoy it a little more.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gravity-circuit/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a 2D action platformer that pays homage to classic Mega Man titles while adding its own twists.","title":"Gravity Circuit"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nCooperative Action Adventure #This title is a top-down action-adventure game that shines in its cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can team up to solve puzzles, fight mythological enemies, and explore beautifully rendered Egyptian tombs. The blend of action, platforming, and environmental puzzles makes for an engaging experience, especially when coordination between players is needed. The visuals are appealing, with strong lighting effects and detailed environments that bring the ancient setting to life.\nFlawed Solo Experience #However, the game isn’t without flaws, the isometric perspective sometimes makes platforming feel imprecise, and the story, while serviceable, lacks emotional depth or originality compared to the mainline entries in the series. Solo players may find the game short and less satisfying, as the design clearly favors cooperative play. Unfortunately for me this is how I played this title, without using the coop feature, and it is not the ideal way of playing, I advise againts it if you don\u0026rsquo;t have company for this title.\nFun With Friends #Overall, this game offers a fun and polished co-op adventure that’s best enjoyed with friends. It may not be groundbreaking or as ambitious as mainline Tomb Raider titles, but its charm lies in its fast-paced teamwork, light puzzle-solving, and mythological atmosphere. This is most definitely not a must-play, but a nice title if you want to experience more Tomb Raider and have already played the other Lara Croft games.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a top-down action-adventure game that shines in its cooperative multiplayer.","title":"Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 1 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nFuturistic Run-And-Gun #This title is a fast-paced 2D action game set in a futuristic world, the MC is called Xoda Rap as she battles robotic invaders in a series of colorful, chaotic levels.

Its standout feature is the unique control scheme, which combines mouse-based targeting with rapid movement, allowing you to dash, attack, and combo enemies in a highly dynamic way.\nRelentless Retro Action #The pacing is relentless, keeping you constantly on the move as the screen fills with enemies, explosions, and projectiles. Each stage offers distinct challenges and clever design twists, capped off with inventive boss fights that demand quick reflexes and adaptability.

Set in a lush, imaginative world, the game blends stunning hand-drawn visuals with fluid animation and a distinctive charm that still holds up decades later. Every level bursts with color and personality, from serene forests to bizarre dreamscapes, all complemented by a playful yet atmospheric OST that enhances its fairy-tale mood.\nSurprisingly Brutal Difficulty #While Rayman may look inviting, it quickly reveals a steep difficulty curve, and I\u0026rsquo;m not even exaggerating when I say that this was one of the most difficult games I\u0026rsquo;ve played in my life. It is so hard that, in order to finish the game, I admit that I had to use cheat codes, otherwise it would be a nightmarish experience during the late-game stages. Its precise platforming, tricky enemy placement, and limited continues demand both patience and skill.\nRewarding Classic Platformer #However, that challenge adds to its lasting appeal, making each completed level feel genuinely rewarding. The game’s simple mechanics, jumping, punching, and later gliding, are used cleverly throughout, ensuring the gameplay stays fresh and inventive. As one of the most visually impressive and artistically ambitious titles of its time, this game remains a defining entry in the platformer genre. It established a beloved franchise and proved that even in the era of 3D gaming’s rise, 2D artistry and tight design could still deliver a magical and memorable experience.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/rayman/","section":"Posts","summary":"The first Rayman entry is a landmark 2D platformer that introduced players to Ubisoft’s now-iconic limbless hero.","title":"Rayman"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nFlexible Stealth Gameplay #This Splinter Cell entry is a polished and versatile stealth-action game that refines the series’ formula with a focus on player choice. It allows you to complete missions using different playstyles, sneaking through shadows as a ghost, silently eliminating enemies as a panther, or going loud with direct combat. Though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make any sense to play this if you are not going full stealth/assassin since this is the main idea of this game, though the \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; route is always available.\nFreedom and Atmosphere #This flexibility, paired with strong level design featuring multiple paths and tools, gives each mission a sense of freedom and replayability that few stealth games achieve. Unfortunately for me, I played this game very late, so I have no experience with it\u0026rsquo;s online features in order to be able to give any meaningful opinion on this. Its atmosphere captures the essence of espionage with clever use of lighting and sound, and the wide range of gadgets reinforces the tactical gameplay Splinter Cell is known for.\nStory and Presentation Issues #However, the story feels fairly conventional, and the change in Sam Fisher’s voice and tone may not satisfy long-time fans, and I particularly don\u0026rsquo;t mind this but I can see this being something that the community would bring up at the time of it\u0026rsquo;s release. While the visuals are serviceable, some textures and animations show their age, and the game occasionally leans too heavily toward action, diluting the stealth tension of earlier titles like Chaos Theory.\nStrong Modern Entry #Despite these flaws, this game stands as one of the most complete entries in the series. It balances modern accessibility with classic stealth depth, delivering an engaging and replayable experience for both newcomers and veterans of the franchise. I would only suggest this as a must-play for fans of the franchise, otherwise, it is just a very good stealth game in general, just not as legendary as it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/splinter-cell-blacklist/","section":"Posts","summary":"A polished and versatile stealth-action game that refines the series\u0026rsquo; formula with a focus on player choice.","title":"Splinter Cell Blacklist"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nParallel Black Mesa Perspective #This title is the second official expansion for Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra. Originally intended as part of the Dreamcast port (which was ultimately canceled), the expansion was later released for PC. This time, the MC is called Barney Calhoun, one of the blue-uniformed security guards glimpsed in the original game. The story unfolds parallel to Gordon Freeman’s adventure, showing familiar events from a new angle. You start your day on a routine shift before everything goes wrong, and soon you’re fighting for survival through collapsing corridors, alien attacks, and government clean-up squads.\nRefined Familiar Gameplay #Gameplay-wise, Blue Shift doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it reuses most weapons, enemies, and mechanics from the base game. However, it refines the formula with strong level design and a smoother flow that emphasizes puzzle-solving and environmental storytelling over pure combat. The pacing feels tighter and more grounded, focusing on Barney’s more human-scale struggle rather than Freeman’s world-saving mission. I love this kind of approach to expansions, showing a different angle of the same events, ever since I first experienced it back on PlayStation 1 with the RE titles.\nShort but Satisfying #Its biggest drawback is its length, the entire campaign can be completed in around three to four hours, it ends just as you feel fully immersed, which can be disappointing. Still, what’s there is polished, well-paced, and narratively satisfying. This game is a compact but quality expansion that enriches the Half-Life universe. It doesn’t push boundaries or add new gameplay systems, but its strong design and fresh perspective make it a worthwhile return to Black Mesa for fans who want a more personal, contained story.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/half-life-blue-shift/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is the second official expansion for Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra.","title":"Half-Life Blue Shift"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nMythic Action RPG #This title is one of the most distinctive action RPGs of its time, blending historical settings, emotional storytelling, and inventive gameplay into a hauntingly beautiful adventure. It serves as the second entry in an informal trilogy alongside Soul Blazer and Terranigma, exploring themes of human evolution, civilization, and spiritual growth, so if you liked any of those titles, this is definitely a must-play alone by the fact that it happens in the same universe.\nWorld-Spanning Hero Journey #The MC is called Will, a young boy with psychic powers who sets out on a journey that takes him across the world, from the Nazca Plains and Angkor Wat to the Great Pyramid. The game reimagines real historical landmarks as mysterious dungeons filled with monsters and puzzles, blending myth and history into a surreal fantasy world. Will can transform into powerful warrior forms like Freedan and Shadow, each with unique abilities that keep combat and exploration fresh.\nBalanced Gameplay Design #The gameplay strikes a balance between action and puzzle-solving: clearing enemies rewards you with permanent stat boosts, and the lack of traditional experience points encourages exploration over grinding. This may sound limiting, but the other elements of the game are good enough to make up for it. Its tight level design, emotional dialogue, and understated storytelling create an atmosphere that feels more introspective than most RPGs of the era.\nEmotional Visual Atmosphere #Visually, it is rich in color and mood, with a soundtrack that heightens the game’s mysterious and sometimes melancholy tone. And while not having the same quality as most JRPGs at the time, this is still a good OST overall, just with a different tone in order to it fit with the main plot. Its story of loss, discovery, and sacrifice carries surprising emotional weight, especially as it builds toward a bittersweet ending.

Set on the mysterious Isle of Nex, the game expands beyond the confined corridors of its predecessor to include lush outdoor environments, from dense forests and swamps to ancient ruins and temples. This variety gives exploration a refreshing sense of scale and discovery, making every new area feel unique and dangerous.\nImproved Core Gameplay #The sense of adventure this title introduced is amazing when compared to the first entry, although I also really enjoyed the experience of the first game, I think this second entry is a much better game overall. The core gameplay revolves around grid-based movement, real-time combat, and intricate puzzles that demand both logic and observation. Many puzzles are deviously designed, rewarding careful attention and experimentation while occasionally leading into frustration due to their difficulty.\nRefined Combat Systems #Combat retains the tense, positional dance of the first game, where timing and maneuvering around enemies are key, though it can sometimes feel clunky due to the grid system. But if you enjoyed the firs title there is little to no surprises in the combat formula, besides new additions regarding skills, perks and spells. Character creation and progression are deeper this time around, offering more classes, races, and skills that allow for distinct party builds.\nAtmospheric Exploration Appeal #The game’s atmosphere is one of its greatest strengths, haunting soundscapes, clever lighting, and the constant threat of danger create a palpable sense of immersion. However, the non-linear structure can lead to moments of confusion, especially for newcomers, as the game offers little guidance on where to go or what to do next. As much as this is a complain of a lot of people, this is actually the opposite for me I enjoyed the semi-open-world elements of this game more than the linear-dungeon-based formula of the first entry.\nRewarding Old-School Experience #Overall, this game is a challenging, atmospheric, and deeply rewarding experience for people who appreciate exploration and problem-solving over hand-holding. It demands patience and persistence but pays off with a sense of accomplishment few modern RPGs can match. This is a must-play if you enjoyed the first title or if you like this kind of grid-based party-RPG style game to any extent, it is one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/legend-of-grimrock-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"A revival of classic dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master, blending old-school mechanics with modern design.","title":"Legend of Grimrock 2"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nStealth-Action Revolution #This title is a landmark in the stealth-action genre, widely regarded as one of the most influential games of its era. The MC is called Solid Snake, a legendary operative sent to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility and neutralize a rogue special forces unit threatening global security. Unlike traditional action games of the time, it emphasizes stealth and strategy, encouraging you to avoid direct confrontation, use distractions, and carefully plan their approach to each encounter.\nCinematic Narrative Depth #The game’s storytelling is cinematic and ambitious, featuring long cutscenes, fully voiced dialogue, and complex characters with memorable personalities and motives. Themes of loyalty, identity, and the consequences of warfare are explored through a layered narrative filled with twists and moral ambiguity. Iconic boss battles, each requiring unique tactics, blend gameplay challenge with narrative significance, making every encounter feel meaningful.\nPsycho Mantis Breakthrough #One of the most iconic ones, even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, is the Psycho Mantis one, which can mess around with the controller port that you are using, and even read your memory far information in order to know which games you have been playing recently. And while this may sound like a fun gimmick, it was a ground-breaking feature at the time, not just on a technical level, but also on a more creative one too.\nAged Yet Impactful #Graphically, the game made the most of the PlayStation hardware, creating detailed environments and memorable set pieces, while the sound design, including an atmospheric soundtrack and realistic sound effects, heightens tension and immersion. While modern players may find the tank controls and fixed camera angles somewhat cumbersome, these limitations never detract from the game’s overall impact.\nTimeless Stealth Masterpiece #This game is not just a videogame, it’s an experience that combines stealth gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and unforgettable characters, leaving a lasting influence on the video game industry and inspiring countless games in its wake. This is simply one of the best games of all time, and an absolute must-play even for people that are not really into the stealth genre in general, but if you are at least a bit interested in gaming story-telling. And lastly, there is also a remake for this title, which is not really a good game in comparison, even though the graphics are way better, I still recommend just playing this OG version instead.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-gear-solid/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a landmark in the stealth-action genre, widely regarded as one of the most influential games of its era.","title":"Metal Gear Solid"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 35 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nStunning Retro Presentation #This title is a beautifully crafted homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Golden Sun. Its pixel art is stunning, filled with rich detail, dynamic lighting, and smooth animations that make every location feel alive. The soundtrack, composed by Eric W. Brown and featuring contributions from Yasunori Mitsuda, perfectly complements the game’s nostalgic tone while offering memorable melodies that elevate key moments. Particularly speaking this all may not sound like a big deal, but when it comes to the atmosphere and overall artistic value of this title, this is one of the best out there solely because of it\u0026rsquo;s presentation and OST.\nModernized Turn-Based Combat #The turn-based combat adds modern twists to familiar mechanics, such as timed button presses, combo attacks, and a “locks” system that encourages strategic thinking. This mechanic feels a lot like the ones you see on Mario RPG on the SNES or the Paper Mario on the N64 platforms, it is very satisfying and simple enough to make it engaging. Exploration feels rewarding, with optional activities like fishing, cooking, and puzzle-solving breaking up the pace of the main quest. The world design strikes a balance between linear storytelling and moments of freedom that invite curiosity, especially because it uses things like a world map to explore, with a lot of obviously hidden secrets out in the blue for you to try and find a way there.\nShallow Yet Charming #However, the narrative and character development don’t always reach the same heights as the game’s presentation. This is especially bad because Garl exists, he is so much more charismatic than the rest of the group that it feels unfair. The protagonists are likable but somewhat shallow, and the story’s pacing can feel slow in the early hours. Customization is also limited, with few ways to meaningfully alter your party’s abilities or combat approach over time, though this is a good thing if you prefer focusing on the other elements despite the simplistic combat.\nHeartfelt Classic Tribute #Despite these flaws, this game succeeds as a heartfelt and polished tribute to a beloved era of RPGs. It captures the charm and warmth of its inspirations while offering enough refinement and flair to stand on its own. This is a must-play for anyone who misses the magic of classic adventures told through pixel art and music, especially if you are a fan of the classics. I consider this one of the best RPGs that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, but I just can\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;of all time\u0026rdquo; due to some rough edges, and I know a lot of people ended up disappointed way more than me.\nShared-Universe Adventure #This title also lives inside of the same universe as \u0026ldquo;The Messenger\u0026rdquo;, and it shows, you get immersed on a lot of it\u0026rsquo;s elements if you are familiar and played this one (which I immensely recommend), and it is a nice nostalgic experience. In my opinion, this title is quite amazing, very few games can tackle the challenge of making simple enough RPGs, with good enough elements. Overall it doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow you away in any of it\u0026rsquo;s aspects, but the sum of the elements makes up for an incredible experience. It has some shocking events through the journey but I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil anything since it would ruin the experience.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/sea-of-stars/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a beautifully crafted homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Golden Sun.","title":"Sea of Stars"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nFresh Narrative Perspective #This title is an expansion to Valve’s groundbreaking Half-Life and serves as one of the best examples of how to build upon an established classic. Instead of continuing Gordon Freeman’s journey, the MC now is called Adrian Shephard, a U.S. Marine tasked with suppressing the Black Mesa incident. This change of viewpoint not only provides fresh narrative insight but also deepens the world-building of the original story, showing the chaos from another side of the conflict. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly a fan of these kinds of additional contents, telling more about the story, happening at the same time, ever since I first experienced it back in the RE era during PlayStation 1 and 2.\nExpanded Combat Variety #Gameplay-wise, Opposing Force keeps the foundation that made Half-Life so engaging, tight combat, immersive environments, and smart level design, while expanding it with new weapons, enemy types, and even squad-based mechanics, where you can command fellow soldiers for support. The new arsenal and foes keep encounters dynamic, and the pacing feels both challenging and rewarding.\nAtmospheric Classic Expansion #Visually and technically, it retains the Gold Source engine’s strengths, offering atmospheric environments and clever scripted sequences that were impressive for their time. Although shorter and less revolutionary than Half-Life itself, this game succeeds by being a well-crafted, thoughtful, and action-packed expansion that adds real value to the Half-Life universe.

Set before and after the events of the first game, it expands the story through multiple characters and interwoven timelines, painting a grim, chaotic portrait of obsession, violence, and consequence. The game’s pulsing synth soundtrack, composed by a variety of electronic artists, stands out as one of its greatest strengths. Each track heightens the adrenaline and intensity of every encounter. I can\u0026rsquo;t praise the OST enough, it is simply one of the best in gaming history, and not just because I\u0026rsquo;m biased towards the Synthwave genre.\nHypnotic Brutal Gameplay #Combined with the vivid pixel art and neon-soaked visuals, the atmosphere feels hypnotic and unsettling, pushing you into a trance-like state as they fight, die, and repeat. Gameplay remains fast, punishing, and skill-based, demanding quick reflexes and memorization of enemy patterns. The addition of unique playable characters, each with their own abilities and restrictions, adds variety, but also limits the freedom that made the first Hotline Miami so satisfying. And this was a very welcome and needed change because, as much as the story is one of the best that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, the gameplay loop favors a lot from a more in-depth and varied play-styles.\nBigger Levels, New Pace #Many levels are larger and more open, which often leads to frustrating deaths from enemies that attack from off-screen or through windows. This shift in design changes the pace of the game, sometimes making it feel slower and more methodical rather than fluid and instinctive. Narratively, this game is more ambitious but also more fragmented. Its story jumps between perspectives and eras, offering glimpses into the motivations behind the violence but rarely providing clear answers. This second entry escalated the story insanely high, with more characters and timelines to follow, it can sometimes feel confusing, but trust me, it pays off at the end.\nComplex Reflective Finale #While some people appreciate this complex, self-aware approach, others find it confusing and less impactful than the minimalist storytelling of the first game. Still, the game succeeds in creating an oppressive, nightmarish tone that lingers long after it ends. In the end, this videogame is both a celebration and a critique of its predecessor. It doubles down on everything that made the series famous style but also exposes the limits of that formula. It’s not as tightly designed or balanced as the original, yet it is one of the best indie games of all time.\n","date":"13 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/","section":"Posts","summary":"The second entry to Hotline Miami is a louder, harsher, and more ambitious follow-up to the original cult classic.","title":"Hotline Miami 2 Wrong Number"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nChaotic Arcade Continuation #This Metal Slug entry continues SNK’s beloved run-and-gun series with its trademark blend of explosive action, hand-drawn 2D animation, and over-the-top humor.

It’s best enjoyed by fans who appreciate old-school arcade gameplay and don’t mind a bit of repetition, but it may not impress people looking for something new.\n","date":"13 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-xx/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an enhanced port of Metal Slug 7 originally made for the Nintendo DS.","title":"Metal Slug XX"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 50 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nReturn to Classic Fantasy #This Final Fantasy entry is a beautifully crafted love letter to the series’ origins, a heartfelt blend of medieval fantasy, charming characters, and profound storytelling.

What begins as a lighthearted tale of kidnapping and rebellion soon evolves into an emotional exploration of identity, mortality, and the meaning of life. Each character faces personal struggles that give the narrative surprising emotional depth, particularly Vivi’s existential journey as a sentient black mage.\nTimeless RPG Gameplay #Gameplay stays true to the series’ roots, featuring turn-based battles and the Active Time Battle system, alongside a simple yet engaging ability-learning mechanic tied to equipment. Exploration across lush towns, mysterious dungeons, and a beautifully rendered world map gives a strong sense of adventure. The visuals, though limited by the PlayStation hardware, are charmingly stylized, with detailed pre-rendered backgrounds and expressive character designs that make the world feel alive.\nMasterful Musical Score #The OST is one of the finest in the franchise, from the whimsical “Melodies of Life” to haunting battle and world themes that elevate every scene’s emotional weight. While its pace can feel slower compared to later entries and the battle load times occasionally drag, this game is more than compensates with its warmth, humor, and timeless storytelling. It remains a standout entry, not only as a nostalgic farewell to the classic era of Final Fantasy, but also as one of the most soulful RPGs ever made.\nA Must-Play Classic #This is one of the best JRPGs, RPGs and Final Fantasy of all time, definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, the genre or even if you even slightly like this kind of game. And although I don\u0026rsquo;t consider this one to be the best Final Fantasy, it is for me very high up there.

Originally developed by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade system, this console port retains the essence of the arcade experience, fast-paced action, detailed 2D visuals, and over-the-top humor, while offering players the convenience of home play. So it\u0026rsquo;s essence is basically the same as it always was, which is a very good thing to keep since this is a beloved franchise.\nChaotic Pixel Adventure #The game picks up the signature formula: side-scrolling mayhem filled with enemies, vehicles, and explosions, all wrapped in gorgeously hand-drawn pixel art. Every stage bursts with personality, from war-torn battlefields and underwater missions to zombie-infested cities and even alien invasions. The branching level system adds replay value by letting you choose different routes and encounter new challenges each time they play.\nTight, Punishing Gameplay #Gameplay is tight and responsive, with smooth controls that make every dodge, jump, and shot feel satisfying, you can easily replay it multiple times in order to see all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents. The difficulty, however, remains punishingly high, typical of arcade titles designed to eat coins, but it’s also part of what makes it so addictive. Mastering each level feels rewarding, especially when playing cooperatively with a friend, where the chaos becomes even more entertaining.\nStriking Visual Excellence #Visually, the game is a treat, the sprite work and animations are some of the best ever produced in 2D gaming, packed with humor and detail, whether it’s enemies surrendering in panic or the exaggerated explosions that fill the screen. The soundtrack and sound effects complement the intense action perfectly, maintaining the arcade spirit that defined the series, it is as always one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind from the very first title to the very last entry.\nTimeless Run-and-Gun #This game is a masterpiece of arcade design, intense, beautiful, and endlessly fun. Despite its difficulty and minor technical hiccups, it stands as one of the finest run-and-gun games ever made. There is little to no reason not to play this if you like this kind of game, and if you are a fan of this franchise then this is definitely a must-play, the Metal Slug franchise really have almost no bad games overall.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Metal Slug entry stands as one of the most iconic and ambitious run-and-gun shooters ever made.","title":"Metal Slug 3"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nChaotic Arcade Warfare #This Metal Slug entry marks another explosive entry in SNK’s legendary run-and-gun franchise, maintaining the series’ trademark blend of chaotic action, expressive 2D animation, and tongue-in-cheek humor. This time, the story revolves around the Peregrine Falcon Squad’s battle against a mysterious cult known as the Ptolemaic Army, who have stolen confidential data related to the “Metal Slug Project.”\nRefined Fast-Paced Combat #While the plot is mostly a backdrop for nonstop carnage, it adds a slightly darker and more mechanical tone compared to earlier, more lighthearted titles. Gameplay remains fast, precise, and incredibly satisfying, every shot, explosion, and enemy encounter feels weighty and responsive. The new “slide” move adds a small but meaningful twist to the classic formula, giving players a new way to dodge bullets and close gaps.\nNew Visual Highlights #The introduction of the Slug Gunner, a heavily armed, transformable vehicle, provides another layer of variety to the familiar formula. Visually, it is as impressive as ever, showcasing SNK’s mastery of pixel art. The backgrounds feature detailed industrial complexes and jungle ruins, animated with the series’ usual flair. The soundtrack leans into heavier rock influences, matching the game’s grittier tone and keeping the adrenaline high throughout the campaign.\nShort but Satisfying #However, the game’s biggest drawback is its brevity, it feels noticeably shorter and less polished than previous entries like Metal Slug 3 or 4. Some stages lack the branching paths and imaginative set pieces that defined the earlier titles, and the boss fights, while flashy, don’t quite reach the same level of creativity. Still, this game delivers what fans expect: intense, over-the-top action wrapped in gorgeous 2D animation. It may not be the most ambitious or memorable chapter in the series, but it’s a solid and entertaining ride for anyone who loves classic arcade shooters.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-5/","section":"Posts","summary":"This entry maintains the series\u0026rsquo; trademark blend of chaotic action, expressive 2D animation, and tongue-in-cheek humor.","title":"Metal Slug 5"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nCharming Run-and-Gun Origins #The very first Metal Slug entry is a fast-paced run-and-gun game that captures the charm of the original arcade version. The game features detailed, hand-drawn sprites and smooth animations, giving it a distinct personality with humorous enemy behaviors and interactive environments. The gameplay is engaging, with a variety of weapons, destructible scenery, POW rescues, and the iconic SV‑001 tank sections adding depth and excitement.\nExpanded PlayStation Content #The PlayStation release includes bonus modes like “Combat School” and mini-games, as well as galleries that showcase the art and animations, giving fans extra content beyond the arcade experience. The combination of fast action, humor, and visual flair makes it a memorable game even on the aging PlayStation hardware.\nNotable Port Drawbacks #However, the port has its drawbacks, load times interrupt the action, some animations are simplified or missing, and certain audio elements lack the crispness of the arcade original. The difficulty ramps up sharply in later stages, and the overall length is relatively short, making replayability dependent on score-chasing or cooperative play.\nEnduring Retro Appeal #Despite these limitations, the game holds up well for retro gamers. Its humor, style, and explosive action remain entertaining, making it a worthwhile experience for fans of classic run-and-gun games, even if the PS1 version is not the definitive edition. Even though this is the most limited one since it was the very first implementations and ideas, it is really one of the best games of all time, proving how good this formula was.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001/","section":"Posts","summary":"The very first Metal Slug entry is a fast-paced run-and-gun game that captures the charm of the original arcade version.","title":"Metal Slug Super Vehicle 001"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 25 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Dark Reboot #This Castlevania entry is a cinematic reboot of the long-running series that reimagines it as a dark fantasy action-adventure rather than a traditional exploration-based platformer. Set in a mythic world of crumbling ruins, cursed forests, and colossal beasts, the MC is called Gabriel Belmont on a tragic quest that mixes gothic atmosphere with epic storytelling. The game’s presentation is its strongest suit, it looks beautiful even years later, with detailed environments, sweeping camera angles, and an emotional orchestral score that elevates every scene. Combat is satisfying and weighty, combining whip attacks, magic powers, and timed dodges in a way that feels close to God of War or Dante’s Inferno.\nEpic Yet Linear #Boss fights, particularly the massive titan battles, deliver some of the game’s most memorable moments. The voice acting gives surprising gravitas to the story, which grows more interesting the deeper it goes. However, the game’s linear structure can disappoint longtime fans expecting the exploration and backtracking typical of older Castlevania titles. Some camera angles are awkward, making platforming sections frustrating, and the pacing sometimes dips between combat encounters and puzzles. It also borrows heavily from its contemporaries, offering polish rather than innovation.\nSpectacle Over Exploration #Overall, this game succeeds as a cinematic, emotionally charged reinvention of the series. It trades open exploration for spectacle and storytelling, delivering a grand adventure that’s both haunting and beautiful. For people who enjoy mythic narratives and stylish combat, it’s a strong experience worth revisiting, even if it feels more God of War than Castlevania. Particularly this is the only game that I have Platinum status back in the PlayStation 3 era, and I highly recommend trying to 100% this one, it is very satisfying. Although this title was not very well received by the community, I really like it and I highly recommend it to fans of the series, or if you like Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash games to any extent, it is simply one of the best of the genre.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/castlevania-lords-of-shadow/","section":"Posts","summary":"A cinematic reboot of the long-running series that reimagines it as a dark fantasy action-adventure.","title":"Castlevania Lords of Shadow"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nTense Atmospheric Action #This title is a strong expansion that successfully captures the tense, oppressive atmosphere that made the original game stand out. The game continues to blend psychological horror with intense first-person shooter action, creating moments of genuine suspense. Dark, claustrophobic corridors, unsettling sound effects, and sudden supernatural occurrences keep players constantly on edge, while the signature “reflex time” mechanic allows for cinematic gunplay that rewards skill and timing.\nFresh Combat Additions #The expansion adds a variety of new weapons and enemy types, keeping combat engaging throughout its run. Levels are carefully designed to maintain a sense of dread while introducing new environments, such as abandoned hospitals, underground tunnels, and eerie industrial areas. The enemy AI remains intelligent and adaptive, often flanking or taking cover, which adds a layer of challenge that complements the horror-driven pacing.\nMinimal Narrative Progress #Despite these strengths, the story of Extraction Point is minimal and largely feels like an extension of the original game rather than a meaningful continuation. The plot doesn’t introduce significant twists or expand the FEAR lore in any notable way, which may disappoint players seeking a deeper narrative experience. Additionally, the campaign is relatively short, generally lasting around 4~6 hours, and some people may feel that the expansion offers little in terms of innovation beyond new levels and weapons.\nConsistent Yet Limited #Visually and mechanically, the game remains consistent with the original entry, which is both a strength and a limitation. Fans of the base game will appreciate the familiar style and polished combat, but those looking for significant changes or improvements might find it lacking. Nevertheless, it succeeds in delivering more of the suspenseful, adrenaline-fueled action that defined the original, making it a worthwhile experience for dedicated fans.\nSolid Horror Expansion #Overall, this game is a competent and atmospheric expansion that extends the horror and action of the original game. While it may not break new ground in terms of story or innovation, it provides enough intense combat, tense moments, and eerie environments to satisfy fans looking for a continuation of the base game experience.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-extraction-point/","section":"Posts","summary":"A strong expansion that successfully captures the tense, oppressive atmosphere that made the original game stand out.","title":"FEAR Extraction Point"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nAction-Heavy Continuation #This title is a standalone expansion that continues the series’ blend of tactical gunfights and supernatural tension, though it leans much more toward action than horror. You step into the role of a new Point Man leading a Delta Force squad through yet another Armacham facility, uncovering a parallel storyline to the events of the original game. The core mechanics remain intact, the iconic slow-motion “reflex time,” responsive controls, and intense firefights against clever enemy AI are still the best reasons to play.\nSatisfying Yet Stale #The gunplay feels satisfying and weighty, with realistic physics and impactful effects that make every encounter a spectacle of chaos. New weapons like the lightning arc and grenade launcher bring some freshness to combat, and facing new enemy types like the Nightcrawlers keeps things from feeling too stale. Despite these strengths, this expansion suffers from a noticeable lack of innovation. The environments are familiar, mostly grey corridors, warehouses, and abandoned offices, and by 2007, the visuals were already looking outdated.\nDiminished Horror Presence #The horror elements that once defined FEAR are toned down significantly, replaced with a focus on relentless shooting that undermines the eerie atmosphere of the original. The story, which runs alongside the first game rather than expanding it, adds little to the narrative and struggles to leave a lasting impression. Even the pacing feels uneven, alternating between strong combat sections and repetitive exploration through uninspired settings.\nCompetent but Unremarkable #Overall, this game is a competent but unremarkable expansion. It delivers satisfying combat and smooth mechanics, but it also feels like a retread of ideas already perfected in the base game. For fans hungry for more of FEAR’s intense firefights, it provides a few hours of solid action. But those hoping for a richer story, stronger scares, or technical improvements will find it more of a reminder of how good the original was, rather than a true evolution of it.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-perseus-mandate/","section":"Posts","summary":"A standalone expansion that continues the series\u0026rsquo; blend of tactical gunfights and supernatural tension.","title":"FEAR Perseus Mandate"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 17 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nProcedural Descent Mastery #This title is a brilliant blend of roguelike randomness and classic platforming precision. It challenges you to descend through procedurally generated caves filled with traps, treasures, and deadly creatures, all while managing limited resources and quick reflexes. Every run feels unique, with the game’s procedural design ensuring no two adventures ever play out the same way.\nPrecision and Discovery #Its controls are tight and responsive, making every death feel like your own fault rather than bad luck. While the difficulty can be brutal, it’s also deeply rewarding: you learn by failing, slowly mastering its many hazards and secrets. The pixel art style is charming yet deceptive, hiding a world full of complexity and surprising depth. The soundtrack perfectly complements the sense of exploration and tension as you dig deeper.\nChaos Becomes Strategy #What makes this videogame so timeless is how it turns chaos into strategy, teaching you to think ahead, take risks, and adapt on the fly. With endless replay value, hidden levels, and a fair-but-punishing design philosophy, it remains one of the most influential indie games of its era. You can spend a lot of hours playing this, finish it, and it\u0026rsquo;ll leave you wanting more.\nA Tough Indie Classic #Not to mention that there are some fun achievements to unlock if you want 100% to make this more interesting.

Set in a steampunk-inspired world filled with hand-drawn environments, it tells its story entirely without dialogue, relying instead on environmental cues, animation, and visual storytelling. The atmosphere is rich and mysterious, supported by a beautifully painted art style and an evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the tone. What made me want to play this was it\u0026rsquo;s artstyle, that while unique, it continues to be it\u0026rsquo;s strongest point when compared to the other mechanics.\nCreative but Frustrating #The game’s magnetic mechanics are both its greatest strength and main challenge. You must use attraction and repulsion to navigate puzzles and traverse complex environments, which can feel rewarding when mastered. However, the physics-based controls sometimes lack precision, and a few of the later puzzles or boss fights can become frustrating due to their high difficulty and reliance on trial and error. By far the weakest aspect are the boss fights, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel natural or engaging enough, it was a nice try to implement a more traditional element into the game.\nCharming Yet Imperfect #Despite these rough edges, Teslagrad stands out as a creative and atmospheric indie title. Its unique mechanics, visual charm, and wordless storytelling make it memorable, even if its short length and occasional frustration prevent it from reaching true greatness.

Exploration and combat are better balanced, making both action and horror sequences more engaging. It is impressive how they managed to modernize this and bring a lot of QOL improvements, since the original title was almost perfect when it comes to this, this remake essentially did the exact same thing it\u0026rsquo;s original did back then.\nAtmospheric Visual Overhaul #Visually, the game is impressive, enhanced lighting, detailed textures, and atmospheric environments create a sense of dread and immersion that amplifies the horror experience. The remake also introduces new or reworked areas and story elements, adding depth without straying too far from the iconic moments that fans remember. And fortunately this time, this game didn\u0026rsquo;t cut any content at all, which was a big complain people had for the Remake of Nemesis. It is quite the opposite this time around, we got new content to enjoy.\nFaithful, Tense Reimagining #Additionally, some optional missions and side content can feel repetitive or less engaging, and a few changes to characters and cutscenes may divide longtime fans. Escort sequences with Ashley, while improved, can still be frustrating in certain combat situations. Overall, this game is a faithful and polished reimagining that blends nostalgia with modern gameplay improvements. It’s highly recommended for both newcomers and fans of the original, offering a tense, atmospheric, and action-packed survival horror experience.

Swinging between rooftops, crawling along walls, and taking down enemies with webs felt exciting and fresh in an era when superhero games were often clunky or uninspired.\nComic-Style Storytelling #The story, narrated by the legendary Stan Lee, unfolds like a living comic book, filled with colorful dialogue, dynamic cutscenes, and a host of familiar faces from the Spider-Man universe, Venom, Carnage, Scorpion, Rhino, and Doctor Octopus all make memorable appearances. The tone balances humor, action, and classic comic book drama in a way that appeals to both kids and longtime fans.\nTimeless Nostalgic Adventure #Though the city is covered in a mysterious fog that hides the lack of a ground-level world, and the graphics now show their age, the gameplay remains surprisingly engaging. The mix of combat, puzzles, stealth, and boss battles keeps things varied across its short but replayable campaign.

The game’s central gimmick, the “Vibe Scepter,” lets Peach channel her feelings, joy, rage, gloom, and calm, to affect the environment and solve puzzles. It’s a creative system that gives the game a distinct identity, even if it sometimes leans too heavily on the emotional theme for humor.\nColorful, Gentle Platforming #Visually, the game shines with colorful, storybook-style graphics and a cheerful soundtrack that fits the DS’s bright aesthetic. Levels are easy to navigate, and the platforming feels smooth and forgiving, making it approachable for younger audiences. However, seasoned fans may find the difficulty too low and the gameplay loop somewhat repetitive after a while. I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly hate this title being easy, sometimes it is good to have a more lightweight experience such as this one.\nCharming Lighthearted Journey #Despite these flaws, this game remains an enjoyable and lighthearted adventure that gives its long-overlooked heroine a well-deserved starring role. It’s not the most challenging platformer, but it’s one of the most charming and unique entries in the Mario universe.

And this level of quality can be said through all Nightdive games, this is one of the best companies when it comes to remakes and remasters, I highly recommend almost all of their games.\nShodan’s Haunting Presence #The villain is called Shodan, reinforcing the game’s dark sci-fi identity and lending weight to its storytelling through audio logs and environmental details.

It successfully bridges the gap between retro design and modern expectations, delivering a moody, challenging experience that rewards curiosity and patience. For fans of atmospheric sci-fi and immersive storytelling, it’s a fitting return to one of gaming’s most influential worlds.

Instead of running and jumping in the traditional sense, the player warps between surfaces, floor, walls, and ceilings, creating a distinctive flow and rhythm in exploration and combat. This mechanic gives the game a fresh feel within the genre.\nAtmospheric Brazilian Influence #The game excels in atmosphere, featuring detailed pixel art and haunting sound design that immerse the player in the surreal world of Salt. Exploration is rewarding, with secrets, upgrades, and hidden paths that encourage curiosity. The game also carries subtle Brazilian cultural influences, adding personality and depth to its artistic presentation. I\u0026rsquo;m biased since this is my home country, but I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this title enough if you have any curiosity regarding our culture and folklore.\nChallenging Movement Drawbacks #However, the unconventional movement can feel imprecise, especially in combat or tight platforming sections, leading to occasional frustration. It is also relatively short, and some sections in the mid-to-late-game can feel punishing due to spikes in difficulty. The story is minimal, serving more as a backdrop than a narrative driver, which may disappoint people looking for strong storytelling.\nStandout Indie Metroidvania #Overall, this game is a memorable indie Metroidvania that stands out for its movement mechanics, aesthetic, and exploration.

Its narrative depth is complemented by well-developed characters, each with unique abilities and motivations, making the journey feel personal and engaging.\nStrategic Djinn Combat #Combat shines thanks to the innovative Djinn system. By collecting and assigning elemental Djinn to characters, players can customize classes, unlock powerful abilities, and experiment with different strategies, keeping battles consistently rewarding. And while this mechanic didn\u0026rsquo;t changed a bit when compared to the first title, it is still very well implemented and executed. Though it has a couple of secrets you can unfold compared to the first entry, related to this mechanic which can lead you to having to replay the entire game if you are not careful enough, it can lock you out of an optional dungeon.\nClever Puzzles \u0026amp; Atmosphere #The game’s puzzles are cleverly integrated into the environment, often requiring observation, logic, and clever use of Psynergy (magic) to solve, making exploration feel both challenging and satisfying. Visually, the game is a showcase for the GBA, with detailed sprites, vibrant landscapes, and smooth animations.

The game’s pixel art, chiptune soundtrack, and grim tone perfectly capture the feel of 8-bit era games while adding a touch of modern polish.

This layer of consequence adds replayability and gives depth to what could otherwise be a straightforward retro homage. Each decision feels weighty, and the different paths encourage multiple playthroughs. The game also features optional modern assists, such as easier difficulty modes and save points, making it more accessible than many of the old-school titles it emulates.\nOld-School Challenge Returns #This may sound like a strange thing to mention since most titles nowadays have these features as standards, but back in the day, you almost always needed to play the whole game in a sitting, or rely on passwords of some kind. However, this game can be punishing early on, with tough enemies and unforgiving platforming sections that may frustrate less patient people. Some design elements intentionally mimic the clunky quirks of older games, which might not appeal to everyone, fortunately for me, this is not a big deal. Still, its fair challenge, variety of secrets, and excellent atmosphere make it one of the better examples of modern retro gaming.\nNostalgic Adventure Must-Play #For fans of classic action-adventure games who crave a blend of nostalgia, grit, and meaningful choices, this game is a must-play. It is one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind, and I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of this style. I also recommend diving into it\u0026rsquo;s easter eggs, it starts pretty early, even when choosing your MC\u0026rsquo;s name can affect the gameplay entirely, changing your default weapon and look, drastically changing how you play the game, it is a fun experience to try and replay using other names and playstyles.\n","date":"7 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/infernax/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a retro-inspired action platformer by Berzerk Studio that pays homage to classics like Castlevania II and Zelda II.","title":"Infernax"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 30 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAtmospheric Sci-Fi Horror #This title is an immersive sim that combines science fiction, horror, and exploration into one of the most atmospheric experiences of its era. Set aboard Talos I, a massive space station orbiting the Moon, the MC is called Morgan Yu, a scientist who wakes up in a world that quickly unravels into chaos. The once-bustling research facility has been overrun by the Typhon, a shape-shifting alien species capable of mimicking everyday objects. From the moment you step into the station, Prey captures you with its unsettling mood, smart level design, and an overarching sense of isolation and mystery.\nTalos I World-Building #Talos I itself is the true star of the game. Every section of the station feels distinct, from luxurious corporate offices to claustrophobic maintenance tunnels, and everything is connected in a way that rewards backtracking and exploration. Arkane’s trademark world-building shines here, as even minor details, emails, audio logs, and environmental clues, flesh out the lives of the crew and the tragedy that befell them. There’s an impressive freedom in how you can navigate and interact with the world, whether you choose to hack locked doors, use alien abilities to transform into small objects, or simply find alternate physical routes using your tools.\nFlexible Gameplay Builds #The gameplay systems encourage experimentation and creativity, you can build your character with human skills like engineering and hacking or embrace alien powers such as telekinesis and mimicry. And this system is complex enough to lock you in a certain \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo;, you cannot make yourself overpowered by leveling up each and every ability, instead you need to choose a playstyle and stick to it in order to it effective enough to be worth it. Each choice affects how you approach challenges and how other characters perceive you.\nIngenious Tools \u0026amp; Design #The GLOO Cannon, a versatile tool that can freeze enemies or create climbable platforms, is emblematic of Prey’s ingenuity, nearly every item in the game can serve multiple purposes depending on your imagination. This is by far the most useful weapon you\u0026rsquo;ll be using, I used this quite a lot, from the start, to the very end of the game, it never stops being useful, especially to clean out weaker enemies, and there is a whole lot of them. Visually, it is striking without relying on photorealism. The soundtrack enhances the tension perfectly, mixing eerie ambient sounds with sudden bursts of energy during combat.\nUneven but Engaging Combat #Despite its strengths, Prey has a few shortcomings, the combat, while serviceable, often feels clunky and less polished than the exploration or puzzle-solving aspects. Early encounters with Mimics can be tense and terrifying, but later battles sometimes drag due to repetitive enemy types and resource scarcity. The pacing can also slow down in the middle portion, where objectives become less urgent and the story loses some of its early momentum. While the ending offers interesting twists, it feels somewhat abrupt compared to the depth of the journey that precedes it.\nUnderappreciated Immersive Sim #Ultimately, this game stands as one of the most underappreciated sci-fi games of the last decade. It challenges the you to think, explore, and experiment rather than simply shoot their way through. With its layered storytelling, immersive environments, and deep mechanics, it captures the spirit of classic immersive sims like System Shock and Deus Ex while carving out its own identity. Prey may not be flawless, but it’s a rich and rewarding experience that continues to resonate with those who appreciate atmosphere, freedom, and thoughtful design in their games. This is truly one of the best immersive sims we got up until now, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.\n","date":"7 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/prey-2017/","section":"Posts","summary":"An immersive sim that combines science fiction, horror, and exploration into an atmospheric experiences.","title":"Prey (2017)"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
