[{"content":" Welcome to my gaming backlog reviews! I go through a variety of games from different eras and genres, from Super Nintendo and PlayStation, up to more recent titles. I mostly focus on retro, indies and double-A titles, more than big budget triple As, but I occasionally also play those aswel. My main platforms are the Steam Deck, a gaming PC and emulators. I also post my reviews on gaming backlog websites such as Backloggd and Grouvee.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/","section":"BackBlog","summary":"\u003ch3 style=\"color: rgba(255,255,255,0.5); font-weight: 100;\"\u003e\nWelcome to my gaming backlog reviews!\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"./cover.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"mx-auto my-0 rounded-md\" /\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"BackBlog"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nExpanded World \u0026amp; Story #This title expands on the ideas of its predecessor by fully embracing the structure of a classic 3D platformer, placing you in a vibrant, cartoon-styled world filled with enemies, collectibles, and environmental challenges. It now has a deeper story that revolves around Pac-Land being thrown into chaos after the Ghosts damage the Golden Fruit, giving the game a simple but effective narrative excuse to send you across forests, snowfields, lava zones, and pirate-themed areas. You even get a main villain now named Spooky, which serves as the final boss, after you beat all the other bosses, which are the colored ghosts riding mechas (quite a creative and unique approach if you ask me). Similar to other platformers, the story will not be the main focus, it is just good enough for it\u0026rsquo;s target audience, which is supposed to be children and also Pac-Man fans.\nClassic Platforming Gameplay #The gameplay focuses on traditional platforming mechanics such as jumping, hovering, and attacking, with Pac-Man’s rev-roll serving as the main combat and movement tool. If you played the first entry then this one will impose little to no challenge in adaptation, it really feels like you are just playing the first game, similar to Crash titles. This cannot be said when it comes to the unique \u0026ldquo;on-rails\u0026rdquo; levels which you ride a variety of things such as ski boots, a submarine and others. The level design frequently introduces new mechanics, like ice physics, swimming segments, and others, which keeps the pacing fresh and encourages players to adapt rather than rely on a single approach. While the game is generally accessible, some later stages demand more precise timing and spatial awareness.\nCharming Visuals \u0026amp; Sound #Visually, the game holds up well for its era, with expressive character animations and colorful environments that give each world a distinct personality. Its visuals still hold up pretty well, even though there was a recent remake of both Pac-Man World titles, the original ones still have a very charming style. The soundtrack complements the playful tone, leaning into upbeat and adventurous themes without becoming overwhelming, using classic themes from the arcades, and adapting for a modern platform. Sound effects and voice clips further reinforce the game’s lighthearted charm, even though they reused a lot of sounds from the previous title, I can\u0026rsquo;t really complain because they are very high quality anyway.\nTechnical Shortcomings #However, the experience is occasionally undermined by technical issues. The camera can be unreliable in tight spaces or during precise jumps, and controls sometimes feel slightly slippery, which can lead to frustration in more demanding sections. And this is a especially bad flaw since at the of its release, other platformers of its era already managed to implement a way better camera system. Some levels also feel less inspired than others, resulting in uneven pacing across the adventure. Though since it is a very short title, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have time to get repetitive and boring, making it a very pleasant first play, or even a replay one if you choose to go for the remake after finishing the original.\nFrustrating Collectibles System #My biggest complain about this title are the collect-a-ton mechanics, which are insanely poorly implemented. When you finish a level, your items are not carried over, which means that, if you want to 100% a level, you need to do a \u0026ldquo;perfect run\u0026rdquo;. This means that you can\u0026rsquo;t miss a single collectible, and while other titles also work like this, this title has way too many items to collect in comparison. And this will absolutely start to become frustrating if you miss even a single one out of the almost 400 that some levels have. Despite these flaws, it remains a memorable and enjoyable platformer from the early 2000s, it may not rival the genre’s biggest names, but it offers a fun, nostalgic experience with enough variety and personality to stand on its own. I recommend playing the remake instead (Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac) and not trying to 100% if due to it\u0026rsquo;s very flawed collect-a-ton mechanic implementation.\n","date":"26 January 2026","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/pac-man-world-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title expands on the ideas of its predecessor by fully embracing the structure of a classic 3D platformer.","title":"Pac-Man World 2"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nAmbitious Dark Fantasy #This is a dark fantasy FPS that expands on the ideas of its predecessor while embracing early RPG mechanics in a way that was ambitious for its time. Built on a modified Quake engine by Raven Software, the game trades pure run-and-gun simplicity for a slower, more methodical experience focused on exploration, character progression, and atmosphere. And as much as it gives a lot of vibes that it\u0026rsquo;ll have a progression system, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually implement anything special. Your progress is more akin to other traditional shooters, you can find new weapons, upgrades and equipments, instead of traditional RPG progression using XP. Before anything, you need to choose your character, Paladin, Crusader, Assassin, or Necromancer, each with unique weapons, spells, and playstyles, giving the game strong replay value and a sense of identity.\nAtmospheric World Design #One of its greatest strengths is its world design and mood, the game is divided into themed hubs inspired by medieval Europe, ancient Egypt, Mesoamerica, and Greco-Roman mythology, all tied together by a bleak, oppressive tone. It is very nice to see such varied and exotic environments for a shooter, especially for its era. The environments were impressively detailed, with large open spaces, vertical level design, and dynamic lighting that enhanced immersion. The hub-based structure encourages exploration and gives the world a cohesive feel, making it seem less like a series of disconnected levels and more like a continuous journey through a cursed realm. Despite all this, almost all the levels are very confusing to navigate, especially the Edypt one which, I admit that I needed to follow a guide in order to progress. Fortunately the last few levels have a very high quality design compared to the first half of the game.\nTactical Combat Focus #Combat is deliberate rather than frantic, emphasizing positioning, resource management, and the smart use of spells and abilities. It really forces you to become more tactical in your approaches, instead of simply relying on skills and reflexes. And since your resources are very limited, you need to take advantage of the varied consumable items such as bombs, power-ups and regens. Traditional XP points allows you to level up and improve attributes, which adds a subtle sense of long-term progression. Though I got to admit that, once you find the last weapon of each class, the game becomes a breeze since they are powerful enough for all the enemies you face. One of its biggest drawbacks is the pacing, progress is uneven, and some encounters become frustrating if the you miss key upgrades or enters areas in the “wrong” order.\nFrustrating Puzzles Navigation #The most divisive aspect is its puzzle and navigation design, objectives are often vague, backtracking is frequent, and it is easy to get lost or overlook crucial switches and items. Like I said before, the Egypt level is the worst level, it is the one I got stuck quite often and for quite some time. I needed to use a guide in order to progress, and since the pacing is very bad, I had difficulty following the guide since there is a correct order in which you need to do things. Not to mention the mysterious key item hunting, there I don\u0026rsquo;t know which is worse, where they are located, or how to use them. There are even some unfixed bugs up to this day when it comes to some soft-lock people face while trying to progress.\nFlawed Yet Memorable #This game really needed some patches in order to address these QOL issues, maybe even a remake. While the high difficulty of its puzzles can be rewarding for players who enjoy methodical exploration and trial-and-error problem solving, it can also feel unintuitive and punishing, especially by modern standards. Overall, this entry is a bold, atmospheric shooter that rewards patience and curiosity, standing as a memorable but flawed classic that appeals most to players who appreciate depth and mood over constant action. I yet to fully play the first entry, but I already heard a lot of opinions about it, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think these design issues are isolated on this sequel, if anything I think the second game actually tried to address the QOL issues, and succeeded to some extent.\n","date":"22 January 2026","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hexen-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A dark fantasy FPS that expands on the ideas of its predecessor while embracing early RPG mechanics.","title":"Hexen II"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Artistic Vision #This title is a cinematic platformer that earned a cult following on the PlayStation thanks to its ambitious presentation and distinct artistic identity. Developed and directed by the same creator of Another World, it places a strong emphasis on visual storytelling, using minimal dialogue and expressive animation to convey its narrative. I also played Another World, and the similar development team was enough to get me interested on this one. The hand-drawn art style was remarkable for the era, with fluid character animation and richly detailed environments that range from eerie forests to nightmarish alien landscapes, creating a dark, fairy-tale atmosphere that feels both whimsical and threatening. As the pre-rendered cutscenes look incredible compared to others of the time. As much as they don\u0026rsquo;t look like Pixar movies, other similar titles never quite reached a satisfying level of quality for this kind of feature in the PlayStation platform.\nAtmospheric Alien Journey #The story follows Andy, an intelligent boy who travels to a hostile alien world to rescue his kidnapped dog, Whiskey. While simple on the surface, the narrative is emotionally driven and relies heavily on atmosphere rather than exposition. So if you are familiar to how Another World plays out, this one will feel very close to it, though with way more dialogs and characters in comparison. The game gradually builds tension through its oppressive environments and unsettling enemy designs, particularly the shadow creatures that inhabit the planet. These enemies are not only visually striking but also help establish a constant sense of vulnerability, reinforcing the theme of a child facing overwhelming danger in an unfamiliar world.\nUnforgiving Precision Gameplay #The gameplay centers on platforming, puzzle-solving, and careful timing, often demanding patience and precision, so nothing new for people even slightly familiar with its genre. Though this game is very unforgiving, featuring frequent instant-death traps that require learning through repetition. And even though this is a very common trait of other similar titles, this particular implementation takes this to a whole new level. Even for veterans, it requires pixel-perfect precision in some sections, which can sometimes be annoying. Checkpoints are generous enough to keep progress manageable, but the trial-and-error design can still feel punishing, especially during sections that combine precise jumps with sudden hazards. The controls, while functional, can feel stiff at times, adding to the challenge but occasionally working against you.\nDynamic Cinematic Pacing #Despite its flaws, the game’s pacing benefits from its constant introduction of new mechanics and environmental ideas. The pacing is one of its strong points, no mechanic overstays its welcome, making it very dynamic, with a lot o different enemies and puzzles to play around with. The cinematic camera work and scripted sequences further enhance immersion, making you feel like they are navigating a dark animated film rather than a traditional platformer. These moments, combined with the haunting soundtrack and sound design, contribute significantly to the game’s emotional weight.\nBrutal Yet Memorable #And while I praised this title for its amazing artstyle, I need to admit that it may be a hard experience if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the stomach. The reason I say this is because of the frequent, varied and detailed gruesome death animations that you are constantly forced to watch through the game. And the game tries to mitigate this by masking some of the details. In the end, this game is remembered more for its atmosphere, artistry, and ambition than for refined gameplay. It is not an easy or universally accessible title, and its difficulty can be a barrier for some people. However, for those willing to endure its challenges, it offers a memorable and emotionally resonant journey that showcases the experimental spirit of late-era PlayStation games. This is definitely a must-play if you like cinematic platformers to any extent.\n","date":"7 January 2026","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/heart-of-darkness/","section":"Posts","summary":"A cinematic platformer on the PlayStation thanks to its ambitious presentation and distinct artistic identity.","title":"Heart of Darkness"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nSniping in North Africa #The 3rd Sniper Elite mainline entry is a tactical third-person shooter, set in the North African theater of World War II. And the setting itself is not a very common approach to WWII games, most of them tend to focus on other periods and places, but it is clear why this was the chosen one for this title, it is a perfect place for a sniper game. It shifts away from the more constrained levels of earlier entries and embraces large, open environments that reward observation, patience, and smart positioning. You are encouraged to scout areas with binoculars, tag enemies, and plan routes before taking a shot, which reinforces the fantasy of being an elite sniper behind enemy lines.\nRefined Tactical Mechanics #And while this is my 2nd Sniper Elite game, I can safely say that this is a complete evolution compared to the V2 previous title. The sniping mechanics are the highlight, once again, bullet physics take wind, gravity, and distance into account, making long-range shots feel earned rather than automatic. The iconic X-ray kill cam returns in full force, graphically showcasing successful shots in slow motion and adding a unique sense of impact to precision kills. Environmental elements, such as generators, explosions, and sandstorms, can be used to mask shots, further deepening the tactical layer of gameplay. This makes up for a much more dynamic gameplay, compared to previous entries, you have a lot of options to enhance your stealth capabilities.\nOpen-Ended Stealth Gameplay #Though at the same time, you have far more enemies, not to mention it adds a lot of vehicles for you to deal with, on every single level, which forces you to be creative in your executions. Stealth is generally well implemented, you are able to eliminate enemies silently, set traps, or avoid confrontation entirely. The open-ended level design allows for multiple playstyles, whether focusing on careful sniping from afar or methodically clearing areas up close. It as some coop features, but particularly I never touched this aspect and decided to face this title as a single-player game instead. I usually tend to go for the stealth approach, but there are some levels which requires more patience than others due to the lack of resources to mask your shots. One of my favorite features is the loadout system, even though it is somewhat limited, it enhances replayability and freedom to how you approach each mission.\nPacing and AI Issues #And this approach helped a lot to mitigate the very slow pace these games can sometimes have, which although I tend to appreciate, it can sometimes be tiring if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough creative ways to approach combat. One of my biggest complaints is the artificial intelligence being one of the downsides, and not one isolated to this title, it has already become a trait of this franchise. And while I understand that this aspect is a very hard one to be implemented, it is still one of the most important ones for games that consider themselves to be of the stealth genre. And for a sniper game, it for sure needs to be faced as a stealth game, first and foremost. The enemy AI can also be inconsistent, sometimes reacting unrealistically or failing to properly respond to threats\nFocused but Flawed Experience #The story is minimal and largely forgettable, serving more as a backdrop than a compelling narrative. Close-quarters combat and cover shooting feel serviceable but lack the refinement of the sniping mechanics, and mission objectives can become repetitive over time. Overall, this game is a focused and enjoyable experience for people who appreciate slow, deliberate gameplay and tactical freedom. While it doesn’t excel in storytelling or technical polish, it succeeds in delivering a satisfying sniper-centric experience that stands out within the WWII shooter genre. If you liked the previous entries to this franchise, there is little to no excuses not to play this one. It is definitely not a must-play, or a ground-breaking stealth shooter, but it still makes me want to play the other titles of this franchise.\n","date":"5 January 2026","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/sniper-elite-iii/","section":"Posts","summary":"The 3rd Sniper Elite mainline entry is a tactical 3rd-person shooter, set in the North African theater of WWII.","title":"Sniper Elite III"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nDark Voodoo Premise #This title is a third-person action-adventure that you play as Akuji, a voodoo priest betrayed by his brother and murdered during his wedding ceremony. Condemned to the Underworld, Akuji must battle through realms inspired by death, mythology, and spiritual folklore to recover the pieces of his stolen heart and seek revenge. Despite having nothing to do with Soul Reaver, this game gives the exact same vibe, based on real-world mythology, and focusing in the darkest side of them. The premise is dark and unusually mature for its time, immediately setting the game apart from many of the brighter, cartoonish platformers that dominated the start of the PlayStation 1 era.\nHaunting Atmosphere #Atmosphere is the game’s greatest strength. this game embraces a grim, voodoo-infused aesthetic filled with eerie architecture, grotesque enemies, and haunting environmental design. I don\u0026rsquo;t have extensive knowledge in the voodoo mythology, and despite it\u0026rsquo;s graphical limitations, it gives a very good presentation on this subject, one that is very little explored in any media, not just video-games. The OST complements this tone well, relying on ambient and tribal-inspired music rather than catchy melodies, which reinforces the feeling of isolation and dread. Even today, the visual identity stands out as bold and memorable, especially considering the technical constraints of the PlayStation hardware. I got to admit that if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for it\u0026rsquo;s visuals, and if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of dark fantasy, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother playing this one.\nRough Combat Mechanics #Th gameplay revolves around exploration, platforming, and combat, though not as extensive as something like a metroidvania, I think it stands out among titles of the same era. You, can punch, kick, use weapons, and acquire magical abilities tied to souls collected throughout the game, but while these mechanics offer some variety, execution is inconsistent. Platforming can be imprecise, largely due to awkward camera angles and occasionally unresponsive controls. Though this is not an isolated case, this was a very common issue on games back in the day, especially on fully controlled cameras. Combat, though serviceable, tends to become repetitive, with limited enemy behaviors and a reliance on basic attack patterns rather than deeper strategy. Akuji is very much capable of defeating any enemies with regular attacks, which diminishes the combat complexity, especially because the enemies are not very tough to begin with.\nStrong Level Design #Level design shows flashes of creativity, featuring shifting environments, traps, puzzles, and vertical exploration. And while visuals and atmosphere are the number 1 strength of this game, the level design is definitely the second. Every level has a decent amount of it\u0026rsquo;s core mechanics, there is not a single boring or badly designed level, or repetitive enough for you not to care to come back to, in order to grab remaining collectibles. However, progression is often linear, and trial-and-error sections can disrupt the pacing. The game is also relatively short, often completed in under ten hours, it took me 6 hours, and I could easily 100% it with nothing more than an additional hour. These shortcomings contributed to the game’s mixed critical reception at launch.\nFlawed Cult Classic #In retrospect, this game is best viewed as an ambitious but flawed experiment. It may not hold up mechanically when compared to genre-defining classics, but its commitment to atmosphere, theme, and originality earns it a cult following. For people interested in darker, unconventional PlayStation-era games, Akuji remains a fascinating example of style and mood overcoming technical roughness. If you are a fan of dark fantasy such as myself, this is definitely worth checking out, the biggest downside being it\u0026rsquo;s availability. I played the original version, and I have no idea if there are modern re-releases. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go too far in order to be able to play this title, it is not as worth as other hidden gems out there, but a competent enough game I enjoyed very much.\n","date":"30 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/akuji-the-heartless/","section":"Posts","summary":"A third-person action-adventure that you play as a voodoo priest betrayed and murdered during his wedding.","title":"Akuji the Heartless"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 19 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCelebratory Modernization #This Duke Nukem title is a celebratory remaster of the iconic 1996 shooter, aiming to modernize the experience while staying faithful to its roots. It introduces true-3D rendering via the Build engine, dynamic lighting, enhanced visual effects, and improved sound quality, alongside re-recorded voice lines by Jon St. John. I have limited experience with the original title, which I played back in the day on PlayStation, and never got past the first few levels, but I have played other Build engine games and I can safely say this is a very high quality product of it. Although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of options such as more recent Build titles, it has a good amount of them, while at the same time, it has excellent defaults, especially when it comes to controller support. So much so that I\u0026rsquo;ve played this game completely using a controller, which is something that I never do since these titles are best suited for keyboard and mouse.\nClassic Gameplay Expanded #The standout addition is a completely new episode, Alien World Order, which expands the campaign with several large, original levels designed by some of the game’s original creators. And by far this additional content is the hardest levels of the bunch, being the most chaotic and unpredictable, displaying the creators\u0026rsquo; evolution in level-design. At its core, the game preserves the fast and old-school gameplay that made it famous. Combat is immediate and aggressive, levels are dense with secrets and interactive elements, and the game’s irreverent humor and pop-culture satire remain front and center. And even though it can start to become annoying like on Shadow Warrior, Duke is way less frequent with his comments. The level design, while sometimes maze-like, still rewards exploration and experimentation, offering a refreshing contrast to more linear modern shooters.\nSubtle Technical Enhancements #The new episode generally fits well with the classic content, even if its level pacing can feel uneven at times. The presentation upgrades are subtle rather than transformative. You can really notice a big difference compared to other similar titles when it comes to the level-design. This game tries to use the most out of the tech available at the time, to try and mimic real-world objects and structures. I\u0026rsquo;m particular fond to levels that tries to replicate cities and more detailed environments, rather than alien-like or otherworldly scenarios, and this title is packed with those. Improved lighting and rendering give environments more depth, and the cleaned-up audio enhances weapon feedback and atmosphere. Control adjustments, including mouse input and camera behavior, have also been criticized for feeling less precise than expected on PC.\nNostalgic Yet Incomplete #Content-wise, this game is somewhat incomplete as a “definitive” release. While it adds new material, it omits some classic expansions found in earlier editions, making it less comprehensive than alternatives available to PC players. Overall, this title is a strong nostalgic package that succeeds in preserving the spirit of a landmark shooter while offering just enough new content to justify its existence. It is best enjoyed by fans of retro FPS games or those with fond memories of Duke’s best days, but newcomers may find its dated mechanics and uneven polish a barrier compared to more modern reinterpretations of the genre. I highly recommend this game if you like old FPS to any extent, especially because it is easily available for modern platforms, there is no reason to play the original inferior versions, it\u0026rsquo;ll absolutely be a good time.\n","date":"24 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/duke-nukem-3d-20th-anniversary/","section":"Posts","summary":"A celebratory remaster of the iconic 1996 shooter, aiming to modernize the experience while staying faithful to its roots.","title":"Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRefined Platforming Evolution #The second mainline Klonoa title is a refined and confident evolution of the original game’s 2.5D platforming formula, using the PlayStation 2’s power to create more dynamic and expressive environments. The signature grab-and-throw mechanic remains the core of the experience, encouraging precise timing and spatial awareness while keeping combat simple and accessible. Level design steadily introduces new ideas, from environmental hazards to gentle puzzle elements, ensuring the gameplay feels varied without becoming frustrating or overly complex. And complexity is definitely not one of it\u0026rsquo;s strong points, it never was, and this title won\u0026rsquo;t change your perspective on this, if you already disliked the previous entries to this franchise.\nWhimsical Visual Presentation #Visually, the game stands out with its vibrant color palette, smooth animations, and imaginative worlds that feel alive and whimsical. It is impressive how good the graphics are, even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards when it comes to this genre specifically. Each stage is distinct, with strong visual themes that complement the mechanics introduced within them. And similar to something like Mario 64, each stage feels very unique, completely different from each other, the only exception is when you need to revisit some levels, which happens often in the story-line. The soundtrack further enhances this atmosphere, blending playful melodies with more somber, emotional tracks that underscore key story moments and give the adventure a dreamlike quality, though I don\u0026rsquo;t think they are as memorable as other franchises.\nEmotional Narrative Depth #Beneath its cheerful exterior, it tells a surprisingly mature and emotional story. Themes of identity, responsibility, and sacrifice are woven naturally into the narrative, culminating in an ending that is often remembered as one of the most affecting in the platformer genre. And this is an unique trait of this franchise, every title that I\u0026rsquo;ve played so far takes the story to a very serious degree, while delivering an impactful ending, and this one is no different. One of my biggest problems with this game is the amount of cutscenes and dialogs, it has too many of them, and they are too long, which a lot of times hurt the pacing, especially since this is a platformer, and not a story-heavy kind of title. While the game is relatively short and on the easier side, this accessibility helps maintain a smooth pacing and makes it welcoming to people of all skill levels.\nUnderrated Cult Classic #Though it does have some extra content in the form of challenges, but they are mostly recycled sections with added twists or rules to make them more difficult. Overall, this game is a heartfelt, creatively designed platformer that values atmosphere and emotional impact as much as mechanical polish. Though it never achieved the commercial success it deserved, its thoughtful design, memorable presentation, and emotional storytelling have cemented its status as a cult classic and one of the most underrated gems of the PlayStation 2 era. This is a must-play if you are a fan of platformers, as much as the other titles of this franchise. I recommend trying to play the re-releases for modern platforms, but I decided to play the original PS2 version.\n","date":"16 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/klonoa-2-lunatea-veil/","section":"Posts","summary":"A refined and confident evolution of the original game\u0026rsquo;s 2.5D platforming formula.","title":"Klonoa 2 Lunatea's Veil"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nProcedural Retro Appeal #This title is a retro-styled Metroidvania that aims to blend procedural generation with classic side-scrolling exploration. Its presentation is immediately appealing, the pixel art is detailed and expressive, giving each environment a warm, handcrafted look despite the fact that the rooms are assembled procedurally. At first I was concerned regarding the game\u0026rsquo;s quality, because using random content generation approaches never usually deliver a good experience. Most titles lack the quality level of hand-crafted environments. But I can safely say this is not the case, every biome feels unique, exploration feels organic, at least to a certain degree. Animations are smooth, the color palette is vibrant without feeling overwhelming, and the game succeeds in evoking the feel of 16-bit era adventures.\nAtmospheric Exploration Loop #The soundtrack reinforces this mood, offering calm, melodic tracks that support exploration without distracting from it. Though it is not as fantastic as other titles of the same genre, this one only tries to fill the silence instead of enforcing a musical identity. As a Metroidvania, it delivers the expected staples, you’ll traverse interconnected regions, defeat enemies, collect upgrades, and return to previously inaccessible areas as your abilities expand. The controls are responsive, and platforming feels comfortable, even if it doesn’t demand high precision. The town-rescue element, where you free villagers who then return to the hub area, adds a sense of progression outside raw exploration. This is clearly inspired by games like Order of Ecclesia and Soul Blazer, and I highly recommend trying to do all the side-quests, it\u0026rsquo;ll greatly help you with progression.\nVaried Gear, Mixed Structure #There’s also a decent variety of weapons and equipment, giving you room to adapt combat to their preferences, whether focusing on faster attacks, heavy hits, or defensive boosts. Particularly I decided to stick to the basics, so I learned how to use the basic starting sword, and tried to use weapons similar to it, from start to finish. However, the game’s reliance on procedural generation is both a distinguishing feature and a limitation. While the curated room templates maintain a baseline level of quality, the way these pieces are stitched together can make the world feel loosely assembled rather than intentionally crafted. This reduces the sense of memorable landmarks or intricate pathways that often define the best Metroidvanias. The result is a map that is fun to uncover but rarely surprising or tightly structured.\nRepetitive Yet Steady Combat #Combat is straightforward and initially enjoyable, but it doesn’t evolve much over time. Enemy patterns are simple, and encounters tend to repeat across areas, which can flatten the challenge curve. Boss battles provide some variety and spectacle, yet they are not numerous enough to compensate for the general repetitiveness of regular fights. The pacing also leans toward the slow and methodical, people seeking intense combat or rapid progression might find the adventure somewhat subdued. You can enhance the combat by upgrading your gear and abilities, but unfortunately this only starts to feel good by the late-game, which makes it sound like you should go for a NG+ mode.\nCozy, Modest Adventure #And while a new game plus mode doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist on this game, I believe trying to 100% it, like I did, is good enough for it\u0026rsquo;s small indie scope. Despite these shortcomings, this game remains an appealing experience for those who value atmosphere and exploration over mechanical depth. Its charm lies in its classic feel, gentle progression, and cozy presentation. The game doesn’t attempt to redefine the genre, but it delivers a steady, pleasant adventure that’s easy to settle into. For those willing to accept its modest ambitions, this title offers a satisfying journey that echoes the spirit of older Metroidvania titles, even if it never quite reaches the heights of its inspirations.\n","date":"9 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/chasm/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a retro-styled Metroidvania that aims to blend procedural generation with classic side-scrolling exploration.","title":"Chasm"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nTactical Hostage Gameplay #This title is a relatively obscure action-adventure game that attempted to combine tactical gameplay with a hostage-rescue narrative. You control an elite commando team sent to infiltrate a skyscraper taken over by terrorists, with the goal of saving hostages and neutralizing threats. One of it\u0026rsquo;s most notable features is the ability to switch between multiple characters, each with distinct abilities and combat styles. It almost makes you feel like you are playing a party RPG, since all the character have vastly different playstyles, about all that is missing is a progression system and a less simplistic combat system. This mechanic encourages you to approach situations strategically, rather than relying on a single playstyle, and adds a layer of depth that distinguishes it from many other action games of the era.\nExploration And Frustration #The levels themselves include a mix of exploration and puzzle-solving, requiring you to navigate the building, unlock doors, and locate hostages while avoiding or confronting enemies. And the enemies respawn indefinitely, but they give you a fair amount of breathing room so you don\u0026rsquo;t get tired of this, while also giving you more resources when you defeat them. Despite its promising premise, the game suffers from several major drawbacks. The controls are widely considered cumbersome, with slow movement and tank-like handling that make combat and navigation frustrating. While I don\u0026rsquo;t really get bothered much by tank controls, they are very bad on this game, your character tries to avoid obstacles on it\u0026rsquo;s own, automatically, and this is a recipe for disaster. Aiming and attacking often feel unresponsive, which can turn tense moments into tedious struggles.\nWeak AI And Story #Enemy AI is weak and predictable, and encounters frequently lack challenge or engagement. The hit detection can also be inconsistent, further undermining combat satisfaction. These gameplay issues are compounded by a story and presentation that fail to leave a strong impression. Dialogue is generic, voice acting is underwhelming, and the characters themselves are mostly forgettable, making it difficult for you to become invested in the narrative or the team they control. At the same time, at this point in time in gaming history, not all games were mature enough. So I don\u0026rsquo;t fault this one for not having a better quality overall, but I can safely say that it can sometimes be laughable to experience, such as the cutscenes. On the positive side, this game offers a certain retro charm that may appeal to collectors and fans of early PlayStation experimentation.\nMixed Mechanics, Low Replay #The concept of managing a small team with different skills is interesting and provides some variety in how missions are approached. Additionally, the game’s combination of action and light puzzle elements gives it a slightly different flavor compared to other PS1 titles focused solely on combat or horror. However, the lack of polish and the frustrating control scheme significantly limit its appeal. Replay value is minimal, as missions can feel repetitive and there is little incentive to revisit completed levels. In conclusion, this title is a flawed but curious piece of PlayStation history. It shows ambition in its tactical team mechanics and hostage-rescue premise, yet it is held back by clunky controls, weak combat, and uninspired presentation.\nRetro Appeal Only #For people who enjoy retro PS1 games and are curious about lesser-known titles, it may offer a nostalgic experience. However, for those seeking tight gameplay, intelligent AI, or a compelling story, T.R.A.G. is unlikely to provide a satisfying experience. It remains more of a historical curiosity than a hidden gem in the PlayStation library. I would only invest any time on this title if you, like myself, is a die-hard fan of survival horror, RE and PlayStation era games, otherwise, this is a very skippable title. And in fact, I only got to know and play this game because I was curious about \u0026ldquo;RE-clones\u0026rdquo;, and ended up finding this gem, was worth my time since it is a very short experience. A shame it has practically no replay value, which is an important thing on this genre in particular.\n","date":"5 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/trag-mission-of-mercy/","section":"Posts","summary":"A relatively obscure action-adventure game that attempted to combine tactical gameplay with a hostage-rescue narrative.","title":"T.R.A.G.: Mission of Mercy"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRhythmic Shooter Fusion #This title is an energetic and highly distinctive fusion of rhythm game mechanics with FPS action. At its core, the game requires the you to perform almost every action, firing, reloading, dashing, jumping, according to the beat of an intense, hard-hitting metal soundtrack. This creates a combat flow that feels almost like playing an instrument: battles become rhythmic patterns to perfect rather than simple firefights. When everything lines up, the game delivers a sense of synergy and momentum that few shooters achieve, making it feel genuinely fresh in a crowded genre.\nOverwhelming Mental Challenge #The experience this game delivers is not unique, but it is a rare one, in a sense of it making you feel like you are using more than 100% of your brain, almost making time standing still with how much focus you need in order to progress through certain challenges. I also said the same thing about some of the bosses in Silksong, but on the case of this particular title, I think it might be due to my limited experience with rhythmic games. Although I learned to play the guitar, and the electric guitar too, I still felt an immense challenge while playing this game, and I even performed some live shows myself. I guess my point is that, if you are looking for a challenge, then look no further, BPM will deliver it while making it feel like a punch in your face.\nRoguelike Variety Explained #The game adopts a roguelike structure, meaning each run presents different challenges, layouts, weapons and upgrades. This randomness helps keep the experience engaging, especially when the game introduces powerful ability combinations or unique weapon modifiers that significantly change how a run plays. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t like this kind of approach to any extent, I advise staying away from this game because it won\u0026rsquo;t win you over. Multiple playable Valkyrie characters add another layer of variety, with each offering a distinct twist on movement, health, or abilities. Though I got to admit that I mostly played with the first one available since it is the most balanced of them all, and I still had a blast, but you can safely spend a ton of extra time trying to master all of the other ones because they are so unique that it ends up being a love-or-hate situation.\nStyle, Atmosphere, Mastery #Because of this structure, BPM encourages experimentation and rewards players who gradually internalize patterns, enemy behaviors, and rhythmic timing. And since I mostly relied on using the most balanced character, I had to maximize this immensely because I had no substantial advantage. Visually, the game stands out with its bold, stylized aesthetic, frequently using a limited color palette that gives each world a strong identity. And as much as I loved the art-style, I had to lower the level of saturation through all the levels because it can make enemies hard to spot. Combined with the soundtrack, mostly composed of fast, metal-inspired tracks, the atmosphere is both intense and cohesive.\nMusic-Driven Intensity #The game feels like it was built around its music, which elevates even simple encounters into dramatic rhythm-driven set pieces. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough when I say this game has one of the best OSTs I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, and it is expected since this is a rhythm game after all. I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I\u0026rsquo;m a metal-head myself, but I can safely say this will please other audiences since it\u0026rsquo;s songs are not really very hardcore, and especially because they have no vocals, which can make-or-break when it comes to the Metal genre. One thing is certain, it\u0026rsquo;ll be one of those games that you have a playlist to listen to from time to time, or even to add to your \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; playlist, for example.\nSteep Rhythm Demands #However, BPM’s strengths can also be barriers. The requirement to act strictly on the beat may frustrate players who aren’t comfortable with rhythm-based gameplay. Missing even a couple of beats can interrupt combat flow or leave you vulnerable, and some weapons have timing windows that take patience to master. The difficulty curve is steep, especially in early hours, and runs can end abruptly due to small mistakes. Fortunately it has some nice accessibility features such as turning the rhythm mechanic completely off, or making it more loose when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s detection, and also four different difficulty levels. I advise trying to get the hang of it in the \u0026ldquo;Practice\u0026rdquo; difficulty level, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you are familiar with either shooters or rhythm games, trust me, this title will crush you to pieces.\nRepetition and Randomness #On top of that, while the procedural generation offers variety, it does not entirely mask the limited pool of enemy types and room variations, which can start to feel repetitive after prolonged play. By far the randomness is the number one factor that can help you with a successful run, I advise exploring as much as possible in the early-to-mid level maps, focusing on healing and life-steal items. Narrative elements are almost nonexistent, so if you are looking for story-driven motivations or world-building will find little beyond the thematic Norse-inspired backdrop. BPM is totally focused on gameplay mechanics, challenge and repetition, rather than lore or cinematic moments.\nA Bold Hybrid #Overall, this game is a bold and memorable experiment that succeeds best with people who enjoy mastering systems, learning patterns and embracing difficulty. Its blend of rhythm and shooting creates a rare feeling of being fully synchronized with the game’s world, even if that experience comes with a steep learning curve. For fans of rhythm games, fast-paced shooters, or challenging roguelikes, BPM offers something unique, stylish and rewarding. People seeking narrative depth, relaxed pacing or traditional FPS gameplay may find it less appealing, but those open to its hybrid identity will discover a fast, thrilling and highly replayable experience. This is one of the best games that I\u0026rsquo;ve played through each and every genre it is trying to convey, a must-play if you like any of them to any extent.\n","date":"1 December 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bpm-bullets-per-minute/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an energetic and highly distinctive fusion of rhythm game mechanics with FPS action.","title":"BPM Bullets Per Minute"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nInventive Kirby Anthology #This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library. Instead of presenting a single adventure, it offers a collection of smaller games that each explore different ideas, mechanics, and tones. This anthology approach keeps the experience constantly fresh, making even short modes feel meaningful because they contribute to a larger, varied whole. At first I thought this was a weird formula, but I ended up enjoying this very much, despite it being very exotic, making it feel like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be a mainline Kirby game in the first place. And this feeling is more related to other less polished games, which had lots of game modes to compensate for the lack of overall quality, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad to say this is not the case for this title.\nDynamic Copy Abilities #At the core of the game is Kirby’s copy ability, which has never felt more dynamic than it does here. Many abilities feature expanded move sets that borrow from fighting-game inputs, giving combat a surprising depth without sacrificing accessibility. The ability to create Helper characters from discarded powers introduces a cooperative element as well; when controlled by a second player, this system turns the game into a lively two-player experience that feels ahead of its time. Unfortunately I never experienced this, so I played the entire experience alone, and while I liked this mechanic, it really makes the game feel cluttered. Sometimes there is a lot going on on-screen that you get lost if you decide to engage with this mechanic, so I decided to very rarely use this.\nCharming SNES Presentation #The presentation is among the best on the SNES, with colorful visuals, expressive sprites, and smooth animations that bring the world to life. Each ability is carefully animated, and the environments feel vibrant and playful. This is no surprise for fans of this character since all of it\u0026rsquo;s games have the same very high level of quality and polish when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s minor details. Every character, especially Kirby, has a lot of animations and expressions, making them feel much more vivid, even though they are just 16-bit sprites moving around. The soundtrack is equally charming, packed with energetic themes that complement the game’s upbeat personality and have become iconic within the series.\nDistinct Game Modes #Each mode brings something unique: Spring Breeze acts as a gentle introduction, very traditional and I think it was my favorite. Dyna Blade offers light exploration and less focus on the combat. The Great Cave Offensive experiments with treasure hunting in a large interconnected environment, and you can definitely sink a lot of hours on this one if you want to 100% it, feels like a NG+ secret hunting. Revenge of Meta Knight introduces a fast-paced narrative with timed segments, and by far this was the most dynamic one, you even get a timer to each stage, similar to classic Mario titles. And Milky Way Wishes changes the rules by removing Kirby’s inhale ability and focusing on ability collection, and I admit that this was my least favorite one, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even finish this mode, I got frustrated trying to find the correct way to progress through the maps.\nTimeless Kirby Experience #My second least favorite is the racing one, too short, simple and easy, and while I like this aspect on most Kirby games, the racing mode simply never felt satisfying enough for me to try and get higher scores outside the minimum ones in order to progress further. Overall, this title remains one of the most inventive and polished platformers of its era. Its variety, strong mechanics, charming presentation, and cooperative gameplay give it exceptional replay value. Nearly three decades later, it still feels joyful, clever, and remarkably modern, it is definitely a must-play if you like Kirby to any extent. It is fairly short even, so there is very little reason not to try this, not to mention it got a lot of modes so you never get burn out of the gameplay loop.\n","date":"23 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kirby-super-star/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of the standout titles of the Kirby franchise and a highlight of the SNES’s library.","title":"Kirby Super Star"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nVibrant Cultural Style #This title is a stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming into a uniquely charming package. Set in a cartoonish world inspired by Mexican folklore, the game immediately stands out with its bold color palette, expressive characters, and smooth animations. Everything, from the towns you visit to the supernatural landscapes you explore, feels handcrafted and full of personality, giving the adventure a lively and memorable identity. This is truly one of the most unique games when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s art-style, we sometimes take it for granted when we experience content inspired by other cultures. But this one is a big standout, not just because this is not a very well explored culture, but also when it comes to the overall quality and presentation, even when compared to more traditionally explored cultures such as the japanese/asian ones.\nDynamic Luchador Combat #Combat is both fast and satisfying, the MC is called Juan, a humble agave farmer turned luchador, and the moveset reflects that wrestling theme with hard-hitting throws, slams, and special attacks. The combo system encourages experimentation, letting you juggle enemies, switch targets mid-air, and weave in special abilities for extra power. As you progress, you unlock new moves that not only expand your offensive options but also serve as keys to explore previously inaccessible areas. This creates a rewarding loop of discovering upgrades, backtracking, and uncovering secrets that enrich the world. And despite it not being a hard game in general, it is still a very satisfying combat, with a lot of enemy variety and a balanced combo system, similar to even something like Devil May Cry or God of War.\nInventive Dimension Platforming #Platforming is another highlight, and the game uses its mechanics in inventive ways. One of the most distinctive features is the ability to switch between the “living” and “dead” dimensions, often in the middle of tricky jumps or enemy encounters. This mechanic keeps the platforming fresh and forces you to stay alert, especially in later stages where timing becomes crucial. It may not sound like a standout feature but, when you start playing while using this, you start to notice the game becomes much more complex overall, not just when it comes to the combat, but especially the platforming. Another standout to this mechanic is the fact that, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle, the development team had to recreate the entire game map due to the implementation of this mechanic, which is an incredible task. Puzzles are generally fair, with a good balance between reflex-based challenges and thoughtful navigation, they are as enjoyable as the combat or the platforming.\nPlayful Meta Humor #The humor throughout the game is lighthearted and self-aware, full of puns, visual jokes, and nods to video game culture. You can even notice some old memes from back in the day, immortalized on this piece of videogame, which is a nice nostalgia trip. NPCs frequently break the fourth wall, and the world is peppered with posters, signs, and side characters that add comedic flavor without feeling forced. It helps that the tone never takes itself too seriously; the story is simple but engaging, built around rescuing El Presidente’s daughter and defeating the skeletal villain Carlos Calaca. And since I live very close to Mexico I had a fond connection to this game\u0026rsquo;s culture because I experienced it in other places such as my childhood cartoons for example, I loved \u0026ldquo;¡Mucha Lucha!\u0026rdquo; as a kid.\nEnhanced Definitive Edition #This game improves on the original release by adding new areas, new enemy types, and additional difficulty options, making this version feel more complete and refined. It also supports local co-op, which turns the adventure into a fun, chaotic shared experience where teamwork actually enhances the platforming and combat. I played this with a friend for the first time, but we only reached half the game progress, then I decided to replay it from the beginning, alone, and almost 100% it. While the game still leans on repeated combat arenas and isn’t as long as some other Metroidvanias, its pacing remains brisk, and its mechanics stay entertaining from start to finish. I recommend trying to 100% this game, it has some amazing late-game content which enhances the experience. Since the overall journey is not really a hard one, the optional contents makes up for this with some platforming, combat and puzzle sections that are very challenging, even for veterans of the genre.\nA Timeless Metroidvania #Not to mention the classical secrets that makes up for the 100% factor, trying to find everything and do every side-quest feels like the intended way of experiencing this, similar to other titles of the same genre. Overall, this game is a polished, spirited, and highly enjoyable action-platformer. Its humor, art direction, and combat depth set it apart, while its clever level design and dimension-shifting mechanics keep the gameplay consistently engaging. Whether you’re a fan of Metroidvanias or just looking for a distinctive and energetic adventure, it remains one of the standout indie titles of its era. I consider this one of the best indie Metroidvanias that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, despite it\u0026rsquo;s age.\n","date":"21 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/guacamelee/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stylish, high-energy Metroidvania that blends colorful worldbuilding, tight combat, and clever platforming.","title":"Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nEnhanced GBA Remake #This game was one of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld. At its core, it is a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2 (the version originally released in North America), but it isn’t just a simple port, it’s a significantly enhanced reimagining designed to feel fresh while still honoring the original. Visually, the game shines with bright, colorful sprites that make excellent use of the GBA’s hardware. Characters and enemies are more expressive, with smooth animations and added personality, like Mario’s exaggerated jump poses or Birdo’s lively attacks. The environments also feel richer and more detailed than on the NES, breathing new life into familiar levels.\nFaithful Yet Fresh Gameplay #I played the original back in the day but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the first few levels since it was too complex for me as a kid to understand, not to mention it works a bit differently than traditional Mario titles. The gameplay remains faithful to SMB2’s unique identity. You choose from Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, each with their distinct strengths, and progress through a mix of platforming and light puzzle-solving. The throwing mechanic, picking up enemies, vegetables, or objects, still gives the game a rhythm that sets it apart from traditional Mario titles. Controls are tighter than ever, and the GBA’s button layout makes the experience intuitive and responsive.\nRefined and Accessible #One of the most notable additions is the increased accessibility and refinement. The game offers more checkpoints, extra hearts, and improved enemy behavior, making it friendlier for newcomers without dumbing down the challenge. Your character has a number of hits it needs to take before dying, not just one or two like regular Mario, and you can also stack them if you play well enough. Whenever you actually die, you ca even switch characters on the fly, and play with the new one from the checkpoint forward. The newly added voice clips, sometimes amusing, sometimes repetitive, give the cast extra charm, even if they’re a bit campy. In my opinion this is the worst and best addition, by far, the voice-acting is so bad it is hilarious.\nWeak Soundtrack, Strong Package #As for the soundtrack, despite me being a fan of Nintendo on this regard, this game is by far one of the worst ones on this aspect. The OST is practically non-existent, it plays the same song over and over, on all levels, despite the character or boss that you are playing at the moment. Overall, this game is a warm, lively remake that successfully modernizes a classic while maintaining its quirky essence. Whether you’re revisiting SMB2 or discovering it for the first time, it remains a joyful and polished platformer that helped define the early GBA library. I recommend trying to 100% it since it is a fairly short play, it\u0026rsquo;ll help with this problem if you try to chase all secrets, not to mention playing as all the characters is also a fun addition, instead of focusing on just one.\n","date":"17 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-mario-advance/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the GBA’s launch titles, and it served as both a nostalgia trip and a technical showcase for Nintendo’s new handheld.","title":"Super Mario Advance"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nFPS/RPG Hybrid Roots #This title is a modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, and unlike most shooters of its time, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics, allowing you to interact with NPCs, engage in dialogue, and complete quest-like objectives. The game gives you a sense of choice in how they approach situations, whether through combat, negotiation, or exploration. The world of Strife is set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic industrial environment dominated by a sinister cult known as “The Order.” This narrative depth, combined with the your ability to affect outcomes through dialogue and quests, gives the game a more story-driven approach compared to many of its contemporaries, making it stand out in the mid-1990s shooter landscape.\nRevolutionary Remastered Return #And while it may not sound unique for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, this is fore sure one of the most revolutionary games of it\u0026rsquo;s time, there is nothing quite like this on this period of time in gaming. The Veteran Edition, released by Nightdive Studios (these folks are amazing), modernizes the original game to run on contemporary systems. It adds widescreen support, improved input options, and enhanced compatibility with modern operating systems, making it far easier to experience on current PCs, or PC Handhelds. The weapons, ranging from conventional firearms to more unique tools like the flamethrower or the mauler, offer you a variety of ways to approach combat encounters.\nChallenging Retro Exploration #I played it in the normal difficulty level and I still had a lot of challenge, especially because all the maps have a very high number of enemies, and they can quickly swarm you. The game’s design encourages exploration, and you are often rewarded for taking the time to search environments and talk to NPCs. For fans of retro gaming, these features help preserve the charm and identity of the original while making it accessible to modern audiences. Despite these improvements, Strife’s underlying engine, derived from the Doom engine lineage, shows its age. Level design can be confusing, with maze-like layouts that are sometimes difficult to navigate.\nAged Yet Charming Design #Enemy behavior is limited, and while the game offers multiple playstyles, many sections push you toward a more linear, combat-heavy approach. Some mechanics, such as stealth or negotiation, feel underdeveloped, and the interface can be clunky by modern standards. Visually, the game looks dated, and while the Veteran Edition smooths over technical issues, it cannot fully modernize the aesthetics of a mid-1990s game. Though for me personally I really like this aesthetic, so I cannot count this aspect of the game as a complete downside, there are quite good-looking titles nowadays which uses this art-style such as Ion Fury, for example.\nEnduring Retro Appeal #Overall, this game is a compelling experience for people interested in retro shooters or the history of FPS/RPG hybrids. It is not a polished, modern game, but it succeeds in preserving the spirit and atmosphere of the original. Its combination of narrative depth, exploration, and combat provides a nostalgic yet engaging experience, particularly for those willing to approach it with patience and a retro gaming mindset. For fans of classic games or those curious about the evolution of story-driven shooters, this one definitely remains a noteworthy and enjoyable title.\n","date":"13 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/strife-veteran-edition/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics.","title":"Strife Veteran Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Sci-Fi Mystery #This title is one of the most ambitious cinematic platformers of its era, a game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences. The MC is called Conrad B. Hart, a young agent who wakes up on an alien planet with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As the mystery unfolds, you piece together his identity and uncover a plot involving alien infiltration and political conspiracy. As much as the videogame industry is immensely saturated with amnesia tropes, this is without a doubt, one of the most unique experiences when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s narrative.\nRotoscoped Visual Mastery #On the SNES, Flashback retains the game\u0026rsquo;s signature rotoscoped animation, which was groundbreaking at the time. The team behind this displayed a great deal of evolution when it comes to their previous delivery, which was Out of This World (or, Another World), which both use the exact same art-style and animations. Every movement, from running and climbing to drawing your gun, is smooth and realistic, lending the game a unique cinematic quality. The environments are richly detailed, with futuristic cities, jungles, and alien landscapes that create a strong sense of atmosphere, even within the system’s limited color palette.\nDeliberate Platforming Challenge #As for the gameplay, it blends platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Unlike typical action games of the early ’90s, it rewards patience and observation over reflexes. Movement is deliberate and grid-based, meaning timing and precision are essential for climbing ledges, dodging traps, and engaging enemies. I advise an insane amount of patience when playing this, not only because of how old this game is, but even for the standards at the time, it\u0026rsquo;s implementation and genre makes it so that you get frustrated for trying to perform the utmost basic actions.\nTense Minimalist Combat #The combat is simple but tense, with your energy shield and pistol serving as your lifeline in a hostile world. There is but only a single weapon, with infinite ammo, and while this may sound appealing, you cannot go guns blazing. The shield can be recharged on certain areas, which is somewhat like a checkpoint for a quick breather, enabling you to be hit at least five times before the game-over screen. And lastly, later on in the game you\u0026rsquo;ll find an item that can stop enemy projectiles, making the combat a bit more dynamic from that point onward.\nAtmospheric Narrative World #Between the action, you’ll interact with NPCs, use items, and navigate dialogue sequences that feel more akin to an adventure game than a standard platformer. The story-telling is a highlight, told through cinematic cutscenes, mysterious journals, and Conrad’s own discoveries. It captures the tone of classic sci-fi films like Blade Runner and Total Recall, mixing cyberpunk aesthetics with philosophical undertones about identity and humanity. The music and sound design reinforce this mood, with atmospheric effects and a hauntingly minimalist soundtrack. This is one of the titles that helped define the \u0026ldquo;retro\u0026rdquo; landscape when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic. It is something that will stick to the back of your mind when you listen to things like Synthwave for example.\nTimeless but Demanding #That said, this is absolutely not an easy game, the controls can feel stiff and unforgiving to modern players, and trial-and-error is often required to progress. Still, mastering its rhythm is part of the appeal, it’s a product of an era when games expected you to learn through failure and persistence. Overall, this game remains a landmark in cinematic storytelling and animation in video games. Its combination of atmospheric design, thoughtful pacing, and sci-fi intrigue makes it a timeless experience, even if its dated controls and difficulty may deter newcomers. For fans of classic adventures and 16-bit experimentation, it’s a must-play piece of gaming history.\n","date":"9 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/flashback/","section":"Posts","summary":"A game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences.","title":"Flashback The Quest for Identity"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBittersweet Final Evolution #The 4th entry to the Mega Man Zero franchise marks the grand finale of the series, and it delivers one of the most refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA. This installment feels like both a mechanical evolution and a narrative closure. A game that understands exactly what made its predecessors great while ensuring Zero’s story ends on a powerful, bittersweet note. Even though it is quite a short title, it still tries to deliver a complete experience, not denying it is a handheld title, while at the same time taking itself serious enough for what it is trying to achieve.\nHope Amid Despair #Set after the events of Zero 3, the game finds Zero and Ciel’s resistance helping a group of human refugees escape Neo Arcadia’s oppressive rule to find peace on the surface. The plot carries a strong undercurrent of hope and despair, themes of sacrifice, humanity, and perseverance are woven throughout the dialogue and atmosphere. The story’s tone is more reflective, almost elegiac, as if the series itself knows the end is near. And this is a big shift compared to the previous entries, which focused more on characters than on the world and the plot behind it, more similar to the mainline entries of the Mega Man X series.\nRefined Combat Additions #As for the gameplay, it polishes the series’ trademark mix of fast-paced combat, precision platforming, and tactical customization. The standout addition is the Z-Knuckle, a versatile new tool that lets Zero steal and use enemy weapons, from guns and hammers to shields, adding a refreshing layer of variety and strategy. But I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t interesting enough for me to want to engage with it, so I barely even used it. I wish this new mechanic was more focused on the exploration aspect instead of the combat, it would make it more interesting. The weather system is another clever addition, each stage has two weather conditions that alter enemy behavior and hazards.\nChallenge and Rewards #And choosing the “harder” weather grants additional rewards, catering to people who crave challenge and replayability. Unfortunately I noticed this very late into the game, so I rarely managed to get the somewhat secret/extra optional abilities you get, and they are very well worth it, I recommend trying to unlock all of them. Difficulty, historically punishing in the series, is better balanced here, and I dare to say this is too easy sometimes. The new Cyber-Elf system consolidates previous games’ complex upgrade mechanics into a single, easier-to-manage entity, streamlining progression without oversimplifying it. Thought at the same time, it is quite toned down compared to the previous Z entries.\nTight Design Brilliance #Levels are tightly designed, emphasizing skillful movement and pattern recognition, while boss fights remain intense showcases of reflex and mastery. I really enjoyed that each ad every level has one sub-boss for you to fight, even the late-stage levels, this makes all this much more interesting when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s pacing. Visually, the game continues to push the GBA’s hardware to its limits with expressive sprite work, detailed environments, and smooth animations. Each stage bursts with color and mechanical detail, maintaining the gritty, post-apocalyptic tone that defines the series. The OST is equally memorable, as always, similar to the mainline X series, but with a more melancholic tone since this is what this series forever tried to convey.\nA Worthy Finale #This is most definitely a must-play if you like the Mega Man series to any extent, I recommend going for the re-releases for modern platforms since you can easily get a bundle with all the titles. But since I\u0026rsquo;m a try-hard, I played the original version instead, which is still enjoyable enough. And lastly, I feel that this title is the weakest of all of the Z franchise, similar to how I rank Mega Man X6, which is also a good fit to end the saga, but at the same time, you know it had way less attention than it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors.\n","date":"7 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-zero-4/","section":"Posts","summary":"This marks the grand finale of the series, a refined and emotionally resonant experiences on the GBA.","title":"Mega Man Zero 4"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 95 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Sequel Reimagined #This title, by Team Cherry, is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight. After years of speculation, delays, and fervent community anticipation, Silksong emerges not just as a continuation of Hollow Knight’s legacy but as a reimagining of what a sequel can be. It carries forward the spirit of discovery, challenge, and melancholy beauty that defined the original while reshaping the formula around its new protagonist, one of the bosses in the first title, Hornet. This time around the location of the world is called Pharloom, so we are no longer in Hallownest. It inverts the descent into darkness of the first game, challenging you to ascend through layered environments, each brimming with its own mysteries, dangers, and emotional weight.\nHornet’s Agile Gameplay #From the first moment you take control of Hornet, it’s clear that this sequel moves to a different rhythm. Where the Knight of the first game felt methodical and grounded, Hornet is quick, acrobatic, and expressive. Her needle and thread weapon serve as both a tool for combat and traversal, allowing her to dash across gaps, pull herself toward enemies, and weave through combat scenarios with a balletic grace. I had two feelings regarding the first few mechanic introductions, one is the pogo, the initial downward strike is very hard to master, and second, that the very welcoming addition of edge grabbing. The controls are tight and responsive, rewarding precision and timing in a way that feels immediately satisfying, and this shift in movement philosophy changes the entire tone of the game.\nPharloom’s Vertical Beauty #The new Pharloom region feels both alien and familiar, echoing the quiet sadness of Hallownest while introducing a fresh aesthetic variety. The environments are more vertical, emphasizing Hornet’s agility and this makes you think more multi-dimensionally. Each biome, tells its own story through architecture and ambient detail, which is an inheritance of games such as Dark Souls. Every corner hides a secret, and every vista carries the haunting beauty that has become Team Cherry’s signature art-style. The game’s visual presentation remains hand-drawn, filled with fluid animations and a painterly sense of color and light that makes each area distinct and memorable. And similar to the first title, it heavily relies in the use of the parallax effect in order to create a sense of immersion.\nA Haunting Soundscape #This game OST, once again, plays a central role in defining its emotional landscape. Somber strings and delicate piano melodies evoke a sense of longing and loss, while tense, rhythmic compositions drive the intensity of boss encounters. The soundtrack shifts dynamically as you explore, adding layers of atmosphere that deepen the sense of immersion. So no big changes from the first entry, it retains the exact same style and level of quality. It’s not merely background music, it feels like an emotional partner to the journey, guiding you through her trials and triumphs. And again, similar to the first title, it\u0026rsquo;s OST it\u0026rsquo;ll also be on my of playlists, alongside others such as Deltarune, Undertale and the Mega Man series. The boss themes are also amazing, especially ones like Karmelita and Lace. Unfortunately, the Hornet\u0026rsquo;s theme is dedicated to the first game, so we never get to hear it on this entry, though I think that it is what the bosses hear whenever we start a fight with them.\nRefined Core Systems #As for the gameplay, it strikes a delicate balance between evolution and tradition. Many of the core systems from Hollow Knight return, exploration, platforming, and combat remain tightly interwoven, but they’ve been refined to suit Hornet’s more energetic playstyle. Healing now requires the use of silk rather than soul, adding a new dimension of risk and reward. And I think that the healing mechanic now is much more fun since it gives you more options, such as doing it while in movement. Crafting replaces charms, letting you forge tools and upgrades that better suit their preferred approach. The result is a system that feels more customizable and experimental. There’s a greater variety of weapons, movement abilities, and environmental puzzles, ensuring that every new zone introduces something mechanically fresh.\nExpanded World Scale #I noticed a lot of people disliking the more limited approach (more balanced, really) to this system, but I think it served this game better since Hornet is more capable than the Knight, already being powerful without any upgrades. One of its most noticeable improvements lies in its sense of scale, Pharloom is significantly larger than Hallownest, with more interconnected pathways, secret areas, and optional challenges. And at the same time, Hollownest was already immense, so be prepared for at least double the amount of exploration. The game world feels alive with characters, many of whom have their own side quests, stories, and moral complexities. These interactions add depth to the narrative without sacrificing the trademark ambiguity that made the original so captivating.\nDifficulty and Mastery #The writing is subtle but emotionally resonant, you feel the weight of the world’s history in every ruined chapel, forgotten grave, and whispered line of dialogue. Even though it follows the game\u0026rsquo;s unique spoken language, you still feel and understand the emotions of the characters since the voice-acting is phenomenal. Despite these strengths, Silksong is not without its frustrations. Its difficulty curve is steep, being even harder than the first title, which is already very hard in the first place. Boss battles, while exhilarating and expertly designed, often require dozens of attempts to master. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough when I say that your brain will be used to it\u0026rsquo;s maximum level when you engage in the boss fights, some of them are so hard that it feels like time has stopped. Enemy attacks are faster and more aggressive, demanding sharper reflexes and deeper understanding of movement mechanics. Not to mention that you now receive twice as much damage, from the very beginning of the game, making you an even more glass cannon character than the Knight.\nPunishing Yet Rewarding #The game also inherits the punishing “run-back” system from its predecessor, dying can mean long treks back to your shade and another attempt at survival. And while I sometimes agree that this is a drawback since other similar games are no longer doing this, such as Elden Ring itself, some may even consider this a QOL improvement. A this can be a satisfying test of skill, for others, it may verge on exhausting. I only really had any trouble with this on one particular boss called Groal The Great, otherwise, all the other ones are very tolerable. Still, when you finally conquer a brutal boss or uncover a hidden area, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.\nEpic Personal Journey #As for the narrative, it feels both intimate and epic, Hornet’s story is one of resilience and self-discovery, told not through heavy exposition but through the quiet spaces between action. And while the first game already set very high standards, and hyped up her backstory, in my opinion, it still managed blow away all my expectations. Her journey up through Pharloom mirrors you own growth as a player, from disoriented captive to agile master of her environment. Themes of rebirth, sacrifice, and legacy resonate throughout the experience, connecting Silksong to its predecessor while carving out a unique emotional identity. By the time the credits roll, it feels less like a sequel and more like a spiritual ascension of everything Hollow Knight represented. While at the same time (some spoilers now), the very first time you face the credits is just half the journey, similar to the SOTN Inverted Castle.\nA Metroidvania Triumph #It is absolutely a must to 100% this game, I admit that I didn\u0026rsquo;t played the Steel Soul mode, but I at least performed 100% of the game\u0026rsquo;s contents like challenges, side-quests and optional bosses. Ultimately, this game justifies every minute of its long development cycle, it is a masterclass in game design, a seamless blend of art, challenge, and storytelling that captures the soul of the Metroidvania genre while expanding its boundaries. It’s more demanding than ever, but also more rewarding. It invites you to lose themselves in its intricate world, to learn through failure, and to find meaning in perseverance. For newcomers, it offers a beautiful yet brutal introduction to one of gaming’s most artful universes. For veterans, it’s the culmination of everything they loved about Hollow Knight, faster, sharper, and richer in every sense.\nA Defining Masterpiece #Hollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the defining games of 2025, a title that will be discussed, analyzed, and revered for years to come. It may not be flawless, but its imperfections only underline its ambition and humanity. Few games so confidently balance elegance and difficulty, serenity and chaos, despair and triumph. Team Cherry has once again created something timeless. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of all time, an a must-play if you like games to any extent, similar to the first entry. Not to mention it is easy to get your hands on it since the team decided to use regional prices, yet again setting new standards, not just to the game quality and it\u0026rsquo;s indie scope, but also when it comes to how it\u0026rsquo;s audience is treated.\nAn Unforgettable Experience #I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this enough, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be better experienced if you play the first game before going to this one. And trust me, half an hour playing the first Hollow Knight will be enough to get you hooked and you won\u0026rsquo;t notice that, out of nowhere, you played more than 20 hours and there is still a lot to see in the game. For my gameplay session I took two entire months, playing it to it\u0026rsquo;s entirety, doing 100% of the content (minus Steel Soul Mode) and I took 110 hours, more than double the amount of the first game. I can\u0026rsquo;t praise this game enough, I consider this to be the most advanced of indie titles, this is the most polished and has the highest level of quality we got up until this point in time. And despite it having a target audience and it\u0026rsquo;s own genre, I still recommend this if you are not familiar with Metroidvanias, just expect an insane level of challenge if you haven\u0026rsquo;t even touched the previous game.\n","date":"5 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hollow-knight-silksong/","section":"Posts","summary":"The long-awaited sequel to one of the most beloved indie games of all time, Hollow Knight.","title":"Hollow Knight Silksong"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nUndead Revenge Unleashed #This title is a remaster of the 1997 cult-classic shooter Blood, by Nightdive Studios. It updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions, widescreen support, smoother performance, and improved compatibility with current hardware, while keeping its signature fast-paced and gory gameplay intact. The MC is called Caleb, an undead gunslinger out for revenge, battling cultists, zombies, and grotesque monsters across a series of cleverly designed levels filled with secrets and dark humor.\nFaithful Blood Restoration #The game’s biggest strength lies in how faithfully it preserves the spirit of the original. Weapons like the flare gun, dynamite bundles, and the voodoo doll remain just as satisfying to use, and the level design still stands out as some of the best from the Build engine era. The atmosphere, blending horror, comedy, and chaotic action, holds up very well. It also bundles in the two official expansions, Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, offering plenty of content for both newcomers and returning fans.\nA Brutal Revival #I highly recommend playing these extra content, they are well worth it, despite the main game being somewhat longer than it needs to be, so maybe come back later to finish it another opportunity. However, not everything is perfect, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice slight differences in movement, weapon behavior, and difficulty balance compared to the original version, making it feel “off” in subtle ways. Overall, this game is a successful revival of one of the best shooters of the 90s. It’s brutal, stylish, and has a lot of replay value, combining old-school charm with modern accessibility.\nBoomer Shooter Masterclass #This shooter is truly one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind, it\u0026rsquo;s originality alone carry the game forward, even if you are not a fan of shooters. Despite it being considered a boomer shooter cult-classic nowadays, it has a varied way of playing it with the amount of different weapons you can play around with. Not to mention it\u0026rsquo;s enemies and level design force you to be creative and use all of them in order to maximize your chance if not dying, because trust me, it\u0026rsquo;ll happen a lot. For fans of retro FPS games, this is definitely a must-play, just expect a tough, unforgiving experience that stays true to its roots.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/blood-fresh-supply/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remaster of the 1997 title, by Nightdive Studios, it updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions.","title":"Blood Fresh Supply"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHand-Painted Metroidvania Charm #This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences. The game immediately stands out with its hand-painted backgrounds, fluid character animations, and richly detailed environments, which give it a distinctive, almost storybook-like aesthetic. Every area feels vibrant and alive, from lush forests to eerie caves, and the attention to visual detail demonstrates the dedication from the development team. The OST complements the visuals beautifully, offering melodic themes that enhance both exploration and combat, creating a captivating atmosphere throughout the journey.\nFluid, Accessible Combat #As for the combat, it is responsive and satisfying, featuring a combination of melee attacks, magic, and the assistance of Fidget, a small, flying companion who adds an extra layer of strategy. Early encounters feel engaging, and the progression system allows you to unlock new abilities and upgrades, giving the gameplay a sense of growth. The game is also accessible, with controls that feel intuitive, making it easy for newcomers to dive in without feeling overwhelmed. The pacing is generally well-balanced, alternating between exploration, platforming, and combat encounters to keep the experience fresh.\nMystery-Filled Hero’s Journey #The narrative follows Dust, a mysterious warrior on a journey to uncover his past, accompanied by Fidget and other colorful characters. While the story provides enough context to drive the adventure, some may find the writing and voice acting uneven. Though in my opinion, this is an acceptable level of quality due to the fact that this title was developed by a single person. Dialogue can occasionally feel forced or simplistic, and certain plot points are predictable, but the character designs and world-building help maintain engagement. Side quests and hidden areas encourage exploration. I encourage this game to be played 100% since it isn\u0026rsquo;t very long and there aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of side-quests, so each and every single one of them is a significant and worthwhile experience.\nImpressive Solo-Dev Achievement #For an indie game developed primarily by one person, the ambition, polish, and charm are remarkable, making it a standout in its genre. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted, engaging action-platformer that combines fluid combat, gorgeous visuals, and a charming world. While it may not challenge hardcore people with deep mechanics or complex level design, it offers a highly enjoyable experience for fans of 2D adventure games and indie titles. Its accessibility, style, and polished presentation make it a memorable journey that is well worth experiencing.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/dust-an-elysian-tail/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a visually stunning 2D action-RPG with strong Metroidvania influences.","title":"Dust An Elysian Tail"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nGex Goes 3D #This title is a 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody, and the era’s fascination with mascot adventures. It’s the second entry in the Gex series and marks the character’s leap from his 2D origins on the 3DO into a fully 3D world, following in the footsteps of titles like Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot.\nChannel-Hopping Adventure #The MC is called Gex, a sarcastic, television-obsessed gecko recruited by a secret agency to once again stop his nemesis, Rez. The game’s levels are designed around TV “channels,” which serve as themed worlds parodying various genres, from cartoons and horror to sci-fi and spy movies. This framing gives the game a playful sense of variety and self-awareness that stands out even today.\nCollectibles and Chaos #Each world is filled with collectibles, hidden power-ups, and plenty of slapstick humor. Gex’s moveset, including tail whips, tongue grabs, and wall climbs, gives the you solid control, though the camera can sometimes make platforming frustrating. Still, for its time, the controls were ambitious and contributed to the game’s open-ended exploration style.\nToo Many One-Liners #The biggest draw is Gex himself, voiced by comedian Dana Gould, Gex constantly cracks jokes, references pop culture, and mocks TV clichés. Depending on your tolerance, his one-liners can be either charmingly nostalgic or grating after a while, but they undeniably give the game personality. Personally I got annoyed quite fast because the frequency that this happens is very high, taking me out of the focus of the gameplay.\nMascot of an Era #And while this title hasn’t aged as gracefully as some of other Gex entries, it remains a fun, distinctive snapshot of the PlayStation era. With imaginative level design, sharp humor, and a memorable mascot at its center, it’s a game that feels both dated and delightfully emblematic of the time when every studio wanted its own wisecracking animal hero. I would only recommend this one if you are a fan of Gex, or mascot games in general.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gex-enter-the-gecko/","section":"Posts","summary":"A 3D platformer that captures the essence of late-’90s gaming, a mix of quirky humor, pop culture parody.","title":"Gex Enter the Gecko"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nWhimsical Gothic Adventure #This MediEvil sequel is a delightful and whimsical action-adventure game that successfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. You once again play as Sir Daniel Fortesque, the skeletal hero with a heart of gold, in a quest that blends humor, gothic charm, and lighthearted adventure. The game’s setting, a richly imagined, slightly spooky version of Victorian England, is filled with cleverly designed levels that balance platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. Each area is bursting with personality, from eerie graveyards to bustling towns, and populated by a variety of quirky and memorable enemies.\nStylized Charm and Combat #One of the game’s strongest points is its visual design. The characters and environments are highly stylized, combining gothic horror elements with a playful cartoonish quality that makes the game approachable and endlessly charming. The OST complements this aesthetic perfectly, featuring catchy, atmospheric tunes that enhance both the humor and tension of the adventure. The combat is more refined than in the first game, with a mix of melee weapons and ranged options that keep encounters fresh, though some camera angles and movement controls occasionally feel awkward by today’s standards. I found myself using the extra combat mechanics way more than the first entry, which I mostly relied in using the regular sword slashes.\nChallenge, Secrets, Rewards #As for the complaints, there are a few boss fights, particularly the one against the Iron Slugger, which is ridiculously hard, to the point that there is but a single way of beating him. Exploration and discovery are heavily rewarded. Secret areas, hidden items, and collectible relics encourage you to thoroughly explore every nook and cranny, adding depth to the experience. The game also does a great job of balancing challenge with accessibility, making it enjoyable for both newcomers and fans of the original. With its combination of clever level design, charming storytelling, and a perfect balance of humor and heroism, this game stands as a memorable entry in the PlayStation library.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/medievil-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A delightful and whimsical action-adventure that successfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor.","title":"MediEvil II"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Samurai Sequel #The second entry to the Onimusha franchise is a remarkable sequel that successfully expands on the foundation laid by the original entry. Set once again in a dark, demon-infested version of feudal Japan, the MC this time is called Jubei Yagyu, a wandering samurai seeking revenge after his village is destroyed by the forces of the demonic warlord Nobunaga Oda. From the opening cinematic, it sets an intense tone, combining historical fiction with supernatural horror and stylized action in a way that feels distinctly cinematic for its time.\nCombat, Choice, Consequence #Gameplay revolves around tight sword-based combat and puzzle-solving in richly detailed pre-rendered environments. The combat system is simple but satisfying, timing parries and using elemental weapons against demons feels fluid and rewarding. Jubei can also absorb the souls of fallen enemies to upgrade weapons and items, a system that gives a light RPG flavor to the otherwise linear progression. One of the major additions in this sequel is the ally system, throughout the story, Jubei can interact with several supporting characters, and his choices, gifts, dialogue, and actions, influence who will join him and how the story unfolds. This feature adds replayability and emotional depth rarely seen in early 2000s action titles.\nAtmospheric Feudal Horror #Visually, the game is stunning for its era, with gorgeously designed backdrops, expressive character models, and cinematic cutscenes that still hold up in terms of atmosphere. The haunting OST and high-quality voice acting enhance the game’s dramatic tone. While this game retains the fixed camera angles and tank-style movement of survival horror titles like Resident Evil, these elements can feel dated or clunky by modern standards. However, they also contribute to the game’s tension and visual storytelling, framing scenes like moments from a film.\nAmbitious, Resonant Continuation #Overall, this sequel is a worthy continuation of the series, deeper, more ambitious, and more emotionally resonant than its predecessor. It’s a blend of action, atmosphere, and mythic storytelling, and it remains a must-play for fans of samurai epics and classic PS2-era action games. I tried to finish this in the original hardware back in the day, but bad resource management and hard boss fights prevented me from doing so, not to mention I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understood the ally system, which can make or break your playthrough.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/onimusha-2-samurai-destiny/","section":"Posts","summary":"A remarkable sequel that successfully expands on the foundation laid by the original entry.","title":"Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nExistence Beneath the Waves #This title is a deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread. Set in the decaying underwater facility PATHOS-II, the game thrusts you into a haunting narrative about identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human. The MC is called Simon Jarrett, an ordinary man who, after a brain scan in 2015, wakes up decades later in a mysterious research station at the bottom of the ocean. As he explores the flooded corridors and abandoned laboratories, Simon uncovers disturbing truths about humanity’s extinction and the desperate attempts of the station’s AI and its former inhabitants to preserve consciousness through technology.\nHorror Through Philosophy #The narrative is gripping, unfolding through environmental storytelling, computer logs, and tense dialogue that gradually reveals a terrifying yet thought-provoking picture of the world. Unlike most horror games, it doesn’t rely on jump scares or gore. Instead, its horror comes from philosophical unease, the blurred boundaries between humans and machines, the loss of self, and the nature of existence without physical form. It’s a game that makes you question your own identity and morality as you make difficult choices with no clear right answers. Despite all this, the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have any moral or decision making mechanics, which is unfortunate since it could improve it\u0026rsquo;s replay value.\nOppression in the Deep #Visually, it captures the oppressive isolation of the ocean floor perfectly. The lighting and sound design work hand-in-hand to build an atmosphere of suffocating tension. You can hear the creak of metal under pressure, the distant hum of machinery, and the distorted cries of something that used to be human. The art direction is superb, combining gritty industrial realism with eerie sci-fi surrealism. The gameplay is mostly exploratory, interspersed with stealth sections where you must avoid hostile creatures. These segments are among the game’s weaker points, you may find them frustrating or at odds with the otherwise slow, meditative pace. Fortunately, the later-added Safe Mode allows you to experience the story without worrying about being attacked, making it ideal for those more interested in the narrative than the horror mechanics.\nTranscendence and Identity #What makes this title stand out the most is its emotional and intellectual resonance. It’s less about surviving monsters and more about confronting what happens when humanity transcends, its own physicality. By the time the credits roll, most people are left reflecting on questions that linger long after the screen goes dark. In short, this game is a masterful fusion of science fiction and psychological horror. It’s a slow, heavy, and deeply affecting experience that rewards patience and introspection. If you value atmosphere, storytelling, and existential themes over action, this is a game that will stay with you.\nA Heavy, Masterful Journey #This game is not for everyone, it is one of the heaviest titles that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and if you are not a fan of this kind of game than I would stay away from this one. I would also recommend not playing this is you have a hard time with horror experiences, because despite me considering myself almost bullet-proof when it comes to these games, I admit that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a walk in the park. Ultimately, this is truly one of the best games of it\u0026rsquo;s genre, it showed how the Amnesia team evolved in absolutely every way possible, especially when it comes to story-telling and writing, I consider this a must-play not just if you like horror titles, but also if you like thought provoking stories.\n","date":"4 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/soma/","section":"Posts","summary":"A deeply atmospheric psychological horror experience that trades traditional scares for profound existential dread.","title":"SOMA"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nReimagined Belmont Quest #This title is an action-platformer by Konami, serving as a loose remake of the PC Engine classic Rondo of Blood. While it shares the same protagonist, Richter Belmont, and a similar story, his quest to rescue his beloved Annette and defeat Count Dracula, it reimagines the original with new level layouts, different bosses, and a noticeably harsher difficulty curve. I admit that I never had the opportunity to play the PC Engine version, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say much on this regard.\nGothic Visual Brilliance #Visually, the game makes strong use of the SNES hardware, featuring rich, gothic environments, detailed sprites, and atmospheric backgrounds that give it a distinct identity from earlier entries. The OST, a highlight of nearly every Castlevania title, is a standout here as well. It delivers hauntingly energetic renditions of classic series themes and new compositions that fit perfectly with the dark, medieval tone. This was my very first Castlevania title, and still today, for me, this franchise\u0026rsquo;s OST is what gets my attention the most.\nClassic Castlevania Gameplay #And despite it being but only one of it\u0026rsquo;s high quality elements through, not just the mainline entries, but also the spin-offs, I simpyl can\u0026rsquo;t praise this enough. As for the gameplay, this entry sticks closely to the traditional Castlevania formula, with methodical platforming, whip combat, and careful resource management of sub-weapons. Levels are linear, platforming is punishing, and enemy placement can feel downright brutal.\nChallenging Gothic Adventure #Still, for those who appreciate challenging old-school design, this game offers a satisfying, demanding adventure. It may not reach the same heights as the best entries in the franchise, but it captures the spirit of Castlevania with its gothic charm, memorable music, and relentless challenge.

Set on a lush, tropical island, the MC is called Nomad, a U.S. Delta Force operative, who is tasked with rescuing hostages and investigating alien activity. What makes the experience truly unique is the Nanosuit, a high-tech exoskeleton that grants abilities such as enhanced strength, speed, armor, and even cloaking.\nTactical Gameplay Freedom #This allows for a variety of approaches, you can go in guns blazing, sneak past enemies unseen, or use environmental objects as weapons, giving unprecedented tactical freedom at the time. The open-ended level design encourages experimentation and rewards creativity. Combat feels dynamic because enemies react intelligently, cover is realistic, and the environment is highly interactive, allowing for destructible structures and natural cover. And this was impressive at the time, though still today, few games try to implement such deep and intelligent interactions with your enemies, so I can safely say this title is not all about the looks.\nGraphics and Story #But beyond the gameplay, it stunned you with its graphics, with detailed foliage, realistic lighting, and water effects that were unmatched in 2007, earning it a reputation as a benchmark for PC hardware. The story, involving a mix of North Korean soldiers and extraterrestrial invaders, is serviceable but mostly serves as a backdrop for the action rather than a deeply emotional narrative. And I wished that at least the characters that you interact with would be able to carry the plot, but very few of them are charismatic enough.\nPacing and Performance #Particularly, I really like the protagonists of the subsequent entries to the series, way more than the first one, such as Psycho and Prophet. Despite this, the pacing keeps you engaged from the dense jungle ambushes to large-scale confrontations with alien forces. As for the performance, this was notorious for being extremely demanding, to the point where the phrase “Can it run Crysis?” became a meme. Yet, for those with high-end PCs, the game offered a stunningly immersive experience that combined beauty, challenge, and innovation. Though as technology evolved, it became clear that the real issue in running this title was due to it\u0026rsquo;s bad optimization, which lead to poor resource usage when it comes to multi-core processors at the time.\nEnduring PC Milestone #In retrospect, this videogame remains a milestone in PC gaming, both as a showcase of technological achievement and as a flexible, thrilling shooter that rewards creativity and tactical thinking. I would recommend playing the Warhead expansion instead of this one, it is a much better experience in my opinion, and I would only advise playing the first entry if you are a fan of shooters in general and want to experience the past of FPS PC gaming\u0026rsquo;s milestones.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/crysis/","section":"Posts","summary":"First entry to the Crysis franchise, a FPS that became instantly famous for its groundbreaking graphics and ambitious design.","title":"Crysis"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 22 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nIsometric Reinvention Begins #This title represents a bold step for the long-running Darksiders franchise, shifting away from the traditional third-person action-adventure formula and embracing an isometric, top-down perspective reminiscent of Diablo or Torchlight. This prequel to the original Darksiders manages to capture the series signature mix of hack-and-slash combat, puzzle-solving, and heavy metal-inspired world design while adapting it to a new gameplay style. The game follows the horsemen War and Strife, with the latter making his playable debut. War, known for his brute strength and swordplay, contrasts perfectly with Strife’s agility and dual-pistol combat.\nDual Horsemen Dynamics #Particularly speaking I paid zero attention to War on this game, despite it being an amazing character, simply because Strife is way more fun to play around with, and works better for this kind of gameplay. You can freely switch between the two characters in single-player mode or team up with a friend in two-player co-op, either locally or online. This dynamic creates a satisfying blend of playstyles: War’s close-range power suits crowd control and boss fights, while Strife’s ranged attacks provide precision and mobility. The combat system, while streamlined compared to previous entries, remains fluid, fast, and immensely enjoyable, offering a great rhythm of melee combos, dodging, and ability use.\nStylized Apocalyptic Aesthetic #Visually, it maintains the series trademark comic book-inspired art direction, with bold lines, exaggerated proportions, and apocalyptic landscapes teeming with demonic enemies. Each level offers a mixture of combat arenas, hidden paths, and environmental puzzles that reward exploration. The music and sound design complement the tone perfectly, blending orchestral and heavy guitar tracks that intensify major battles and boss encounters.\nPrequel Hunt for Lucifer #The game’s story takes place before the events of the first Darksiders, exploring the early days of the Horsemen’s service to the Charred Council. It follows War and Strife as they hunt down a demon prince named Lucifer, who is plotting to upset the balance between Heaven and Hell. While the plot isn’t groundbreaking, it provides enough intrigue and personality to sustain the adventure. The banter between the two protagonists is a highlight, Strife’s witty, sarcastic humor plays well off War’s stoic seriousness, giving the duo a fun “buddy cop” dynamic that keeps cutscenes entertaining.\nFlaws Amid Stylish Chaos #Despite its strengths, this game isn’t without flaws, the isometric viewpoint can occasionally make combat or navigation feel imprecise, especially during sections requiring platforming or tight jumps. The story, while entertaining, leans more on humor and action than emotional weight or character development. Some people may also find the loot and customization systems lighter than expected, especially if they’re coming from loot-driven action RPGs. Still, these shortcomings are balanced by the game’s brisk pacing, satisfying combat, and creative level design.\nA Fresh Darksiders Vision #Ultimately, this game succeeds in delivering a compact but stylish reimagining of the franchise. It may not match the grand scale or narrative ambition of its predecessors, but its focus on fun, fast-paced gameplay and cooperative action makes it a standout entry in its own right. It’s a testament to the flexibility of the Darksiders universe that such a different approach can still feel authentic to its roots. Whether you’re a long-time fan or a newcomer looking for a well-crafted action game, it is still an easy recommendation since it has a ton of replay value.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/darksiders-genesis/","section":"Posts","summary":"A bold step for the long-running Darksiders franchise, shifting away from the traditional third-person formula.","title":"Darksiders Genesis"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nVillainous Hero Origins #This title is a dark fantasy action-platformer developed and published by Capcom, serving as the third entry in the Gargoyle’s Quest series, which spun off from Ghosts ’n Goblins. Released late in the SNES lifespan, it didn’t receive much commercial attention at the time, but it has since become a cult classic, and for good reason. The MC is called Firebrand, the red demon who was once a recurring boss in Ghosts ’n Goblins. Particularly speaking I was not a fan of games in which you play as the villain at first, but I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love this approach to story-telling, it deepens the lore, universe and the backstory behind the events of previous titles.\nQuest for Elemental Crests #The story follows him after a great demon war, where he sets out to reclaim six powerful elemental crests that grant control over fire, earth, water, air, time, and heaven. These crests allow you to transform into different forms, each with unique abilities that open up new paths, giving the game a structure reminiscent of early Metroidvania titles. The gameplay blends precise platforming, combat, and exploration. You can fly short distances, cling to walls, and use various projectile attacks. Levels are non-linear, with a world map that lets you revisit areas to uncover secrets and optional bosses once you’ve unlocked new abilities.\nSecrets and Challenge #For me the best aspect of this title are it\u0026rsquo;s secrets, in general the mainline story is very short, but it really shines when you decide to go 100%. I highly recommend doing so, this really feels like the intended way of playing this. The difficulty is tough but fair, it demands patience and mastery of Firebrand’s powers. The most difficult sections for me were the bosses, made worse by the lack of QOL of modern gaming such as more frequent checkpoints, meaning that you got very little time to learn the boss patterns and try again.\nBosses, Visuals, Soundtrack #This is why I advise using save states for the bosses, and don\u0026rsquo;t feel ashamed if doing so, this is one of the many flawed games when it comes to the difficulty spikes of the back in the day game design. Visually, this game is stunning for its time, the sprite work is detailed and expressive, with gothic architecture, eerie lighting, and foreboding enemy designs that create a beautifully grim atmosphere. The OST complements this perfectly, featuring haunting organ melodies and moody ambient tones that reinforce the game’s dark tone.\nCult Classic Recognition #Despite its brilliance, this game was a commercial failure upon release, partly due to poor marketing and stiff competition in 1994. However, in hindsight, it’s regarded as one of the SNES’s finest hidden gems, a moody, artistically ambitious, and mechanically refined platformer that showcases Capcom at its creative peak. If you enjoy atmospheric action games with exploration and challenge, this title is an unforgettable experience that still holds up remarkably well today.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/demon-crest/","section":"Posts","summary":"A dark fantasy action-platformer, being the 3rd entry in the Gargoyle\u0026rsquo;s Quest series, a spin-off from Ghosts \u0026rsquo;n Goblins.","title":"Demon's Crest"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBirth of Stylish Combat #The very first entry to the Devil May Cry franchise is widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre. The MC is called Dante, a charismatic and cocky demon hunter on a mission to defeat the powerful demon Mundus and unravel the mysteries of his own past. From the very first moments, the game sets a dark, gothic tone with its foreboding castle setting, intricate level design, and cinematic cutscenes that feel almost like interactive movies. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly rewarding, blending swordplay, acrobatics, and gun combat.\nStyle-Driven Action Mastery #You can chain together elaborate combos, juggling enemies in the air and switching seamlessly between melee and ranged attacks. It encourages you to fight with style, awarding rankings from “D” to “Stylish” based not just on survival, but on creativity, speed, and variety in combat. And despite score systems being a common thing in nowadays gameplay design, the more dynamic, unique and full of personality one like the first DMC\u0026rsquo;s implementation was a standout back in the day. Boss battles are particularly memorable, often requiring both skill and strategy, and each one feels like a true test of mastery.\nInnovative Combat Foundations #The controls and combat systems were innovative for their time, giving you a sense of freedom and power rarely seen in early 2000s action games. The OST complement the intense action, from epic orchestral pieces to edgy rock tracks, further enhancing the experience, though I think that this very first DMC had a more shy style for it\u0026rsquo;s songs when compared to subsequent entries. While some people might find the difficulty steep and the camera occasionally challenging, these aspects also add to the sense of accomplishment when battles are won.\nA Genre-Defining Legacy #Beyond gameplay, this game established a lasting legacy with its over-the-top style, memorable protagonist, and influence on countless action titles that followed. It spawned a franchise that continues to be celebrated today, and its blend of challenge, style, and narrative depth makes it a standout title on it\u0026rsquo;s platform that still holds up remarkably well. This is truly one of the milestones in gaming history, especially when it comes to this genre, a must-play if you have the opportunity to experience this in modern platforms. Despite my high praise on this title, I still think this sits in the weak spot of the franchise, though not in a bad way, but simply because it\u0026rsquo;s sequels improved upon it\u0026rsquo;s foundations much more that makes the OG DMC a little gray in comparison.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/devil-may-cry/","section":"Posts","summary":"A widely regarded as a seminal action game that helped define the Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash genre.","title":"Devil May Cry"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 11 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nA Fresh Direction #This title marks a bold and refreshing detour from the traditional Tomb Raider formula. Instead of the usual third-person adventure with cinematic storytelling, this spin-off embraces an isometric camera view, arcade-style combat, and cooperative puzzle-solving. The result is a tightly designed action-adventure game that feels both nostalgic and inventive. The story is light but effective, Lara teams up with Totec, an ancient Mayan warrior resurrected to help stop the evil spirit Xolotl from plunging the world into darkness. The narrative mostly serves as a backdrop for the gameplay, which is where the real fun lies.\nCoop-Centric Gameplay #The campaign can be played solo or in two-player coop, and it’s in coop that the game truly shines, many puzzles and combat encounters are cleverly designed to encourage teamwork, with Lara’s grappling hook and Totec’s spear-throwing creating dynamic ways to navigate levels. Unortunately for me, like many coop titles that I played, I experienced this one alone, and it was still an enjoyable experience, so I still recommend this title for solo players. The gameplay blends twin-stick shooting, platforming, and environmental puzzles seamlessly. Combat feels fast and responsive, with a nice variety of weapons, relics, and artifacts that modify abilities and encourage experimentation.\nClever Puzzles \u0026amp; Atmosphere #The puzzles strike a satisfying balance between clever and intuitive, rewarding exploration without being frustrating. The isometric perspective gives the game a distinct arcade feel, though it can sometimes make depth perception tricky during jumps or traps. Visually, the game still holds up well for its age, the environments, ancient temples, crumbling ruins, and trap-filled chambers, are detailed and atmospheric. The OST complements the setting with an adventurous tone, and the performance is smooth even on modest hardware, so this is a well-suited game for older systems, or even for handhelds.\nAn Underrated Adventure #Overall, this title is a well-crafted, fast-paced adventure that proves the franchise can thrive outside its usual formula. Its tight mechanics, inventive coop design, and rewarding gameplay loop make it one of the most underrated gems of it\u0026rsquo;s time. Despite me praising it so much, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a must-play outside of the fans to this franchise, or if you are really into story-driven coop campaign titles, which there aren\u0026rsquo;t really that much to play anyway when it comes to these types of videogames.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title marks a bold and refreshing detour from the traditional Tomb Raider formula.","title":"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nModern Reimagined Classic #This title is a modern reimagining of the 1997 cult classic, rather than simply copying the old formula, the reboot successfully fuses nostalgic ‘90s shooter energy with slick, modern gameplay and visuals. The MC is called Lo Wang, a sharp-tongued mercenary who gets tangled in a demonic invasion after a botched mission to retrieve a mysterious sword. What follows is a blend of intense first-person combat, dark humor, and mythological storytelling with a surprising amount of heart.\nBrutal Fluid Combat #The game’s biggest strength lies in its combat system, which balances frantic gunfights with brutally satisfying swordplay. The katana mechanics are deep and responsive, letting you chain slashes, decapitations, and special attacks with precision. Firearms like shotguns and crossbows complement the melee action perfectly, giving you multiple ways to approach every encounter. The arenas are designed to encourage mobility and experimentation, rewarding aggressive play and skillful combos.\nStyle, Sound, Personality #Visually, it still looks sharp, with colorful environments and detailed enemies. The OST amps up the action with pulse-pounding energy, while the sound design sells every slash and explosion. What really makes the experience stand out, though, is the personality, Lo Wang’s mix of cheesy one-liners, self-awareness, and unexpected depth makes him one of the more memorable FPS protagonists of the 2010s. There are very few hidden gems of the FPS genre of this era of gaming, one of them is this one, along with titles such as The Darkness, they are very similar when it comes to the gameplay, there is a lot to like on this one if you enjoy this kind of shooter.\nEmotional, Stylish Reboot #While the story isn’t groundbreaking, it manages to surprise with genuine emotional beats and a well-paced finale. You also get some story-telling via comic-book-like cutscenes, similar to Max Payne, but instead of the Noir tone, this time you get a more anime-like art-style, with very good animated, beautifully designed, and with amazing voice-acting. Overall, this title is a stylish, fun, and brutally entertaining reboot that honors its roots while carving out its own identity as one of the most satisfying single-player shooters of its time.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/shadow-warrior/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern reimagining of the 1997 cult classic, fusing nostalgic ‘90s shooter energy with slick, modern gameplay and visuals.","title":"Shadow Warrior"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDefining 16-Bit Transition #The 4th mainline entry to the Castlevania franchise is one of the finest examples of how a series can successfully transition into a new generation of hardware. Serving as both a remake and reimagining of the original Castlevania from the NES, it refines nearly every aspect of the classic formula. The MC is called Simon Belmont, armed with his iconic whip and tasked with venturing through Dracula’s monstrous castle to defeat the Count and his legion of undead minions.\nRevolutionized Classic Controls #The gameplay builds on the series trademark mix of precision platforming and punishing combat, but introduces smoother controls that feel revolutionary compared to earlier titles. You can now whip in eight directions, use his whip as a grappling tool, and move more freely through intricately designed stages. This control overhaul makes this game one of the most fluid and satisfying entries in the franchise’s classic era.\nMode-7 Gothic Showcase #Visually, the game is a showcase of the SNES’s capabilities. Konami used the console’s Mode 7 effects to create dizzying rotating rooms, shifting corridors, and surreal backgrounds that gave you a sense of being inside a living, breathing nightmare. The attention to detail in the gothic architecture, eerie lighting, and atmospheric animations adds to the sense of foreboding that defines the Castlevania series.\nIconic Symphonic Soundscape #The OST, deserves special praise, it blends haunting organ melodies, baroque-inspired arrangements, and driving percussion to perfectly complement the dark fantasy setting. Tracks like “Simon’s Theme” and “Clockwork Mansion” have since become iconic, showcasing the SNES’s sound chip at its best, and solidifying even more one of the best aspects of the Castlevania franchise, the high quality and memorable soundtracks.\nTimeless Castlevania Masterpiece #While this game remains linear compared to later Metroidvania titles like SOTN, its pacing, variety, and challenge make it deeply rewarding. It stands as both a nostalgic tribute to the series roots and a technical masterpiece of early 16-bit gaming. Even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, it’s still celebrated for its atmosphere, music, and perfect blend of horror and action. This is a must-play for fans of the Castlevania franchise such as myself, and with the recent collections being re-released it is an easy recommedation.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-castlevania-iv/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is one of the finest examples of how a series can successfully transition into a new generation of hardware.","title":"Super Castlevania IV"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nRefined Espionage Sequel #This title builds upon the foundation of the first game, delivering a more polished and ambitious experience that cements its place among the PlayStation’s best action titles. The game continues the story of special agents Gabe Logan and Lian Xing as they unravel a government conspiracy surrounding the deadly Syphon Filter virus. The sequel picks up immediately after the events of the original, thrusting players into a fast-paced narrative filled with espionage, betrayal, and moral ambiguity.\nCinematic Evolution Arrives #The story is more cinematic this time, told through frequent cutscenes and voice acting that was impressive for its era. The writing also takes a darker tone, giving both protagonists more emotional depth as they find themselves hunted by the very agency they once served. As for the gameplay, it refines nearly every aspect of the original, the combination of third-person shooting and stealth action feels tighter, with smoother controls and improved targeting. Levels are larger and more varied, taking you from snowy mountain bases to desert complexes and underground laboratories.\nDynamic Mission Variety #Each mission encourages a mix of stealth, strategy, and all-out gunfights, creating a dynamic flow that keeps the experience fresh. It even has some sections in which you have backup from other soldiers, into the action, or have to make sure they don\u0026rsquo;t die since they are all part of your team, making it a much more believable experience. The game’s arsenal is another highlight, from silenced pistols and machine guns to explosive weapons and, of course, the infamous high-voltage Taser that lets you set enemies ablaze from a distance.\nSmarter Stealth Focus #Enemy AI is noticeably improved, forcing you to plan their approach rather than charge in blindly. And compared to the previous entry, this time around you have a lot more stealth sections, making this sequel a more varied entry to the action-packed one that was introduced in the very first title. Visually, the game pushes the PlayStation hardware to its limits, while character models and environments look blocky today, the atmosphere, enhanced by strong lighting effects and a tense soundtrack, was impressive back in the day.\nA Defining Classic #In retrospect, this game represents a high point for late-era PlayStation action games. Its mix of espionage storytelling, tactical gameplay, and memorable moments made it one of the defining titles of its generation. This was a standout stealth-action sequel that improves on nearly every aspect of the original, this title remains a thrilling and influential entry in PlayStation history, one of the most memorable titles of it\u0026rsquo;s platform, and of the era that it lived in.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/syphon-filter-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"This sequel delivers a more polished and ambitious experience that cements its place among the PlayStation’s best titles.","title":"Syphon Filter 2"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 13 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAtmospheric Sci-Fi Awakening #This title is an outstanding indie metroidvania that manages to feel both nostalgic and refreshingly original. Developed almost entirely by a single person, it’s a remarkable achievement in atmosphere, design, and storytelling. The MC is called Trace, a scientist who wakes up in a strange, hostile alien world after a lab accident. From the opening moments, Axiom Verge establishes a haunting tone through its glitchy visuals, cryptic dialogue, and droning synth OST. One of it\u0026rsquo;s standouts to me is it\u0026rsquo;s OST, not just because I\u0026rsquo;m biased towards Synth music in general, but because it\u0026rsquo;s OST is at the same level of giants such as Metroid. The environments, industrial ruins, pulsing organic tunnels, and machine-infested caverns.\nSurreal Exploration Mastery #The game’s world design is clearly inspired by Super Metroid, but it is more surreal and experimental, blending biotech horror with a subtle undercurrent of existential dread. The gameplay revolves around exploration and gradual empowerment. Every new weapon or gadget, like the Address Disruptor, which “glitches” enemies and terrain to reveal secrets, adds layers of discovery. Combat feels deliberate, and though enemy variety can be repetitive, the sheer number of weapons (over 20) keeps things interesting. The boss battles are large, tense encounters that demand precision and pattern recognition.\nGlitch-Driven Narrative Depth #One of it\u0026rsquo;s strongest traits is how it uses its retro aesthetic to enhance its identity rather than merely imitate old games. The visual “glitches” are not just stylistic, they’re part of the world and narrative, blurring the line between game and code. The story, told through scattered terminals and brief dialogue, encourages interpretation, leaving you to piece together its larger mysteries. And this is one of my favorite aspects of this title, since I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to like this kind of approach to story-telling, so if you are like me, this is one of the best experiences you can have when it comes to expanded lore beyond in-game events.\nChallenging Yet Essential #If there’s one drawback, it’s that navigation can sometimes feel cumbersome, especially without a fast-travel system, similar to the experience you\u0026rsquo;ll face if you play the early, and less mature, Metroid implementations. Still, the sense of exploration and discovery is rarely lost. In summary, this game is an atmospheric, imaginative, and deeply crafted tribute to the 16-bit era. It’s a testament to what one creator can achieve, an essential experience for fans of exploration-driven action games. This is definitely one of the best games that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, not just for it\u0026rsquo;s genre, but in general, especially because the story is the perfect fit for me, with alternative universes, identity and even time travel, but I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil anything not to ruin any experiences. It is an absolute must-play if you like Metroidvanias to any extent.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/axiom-verge/","section":"Posts","summary":"An outstanding indie metroidvania that manages to feel both nostalgic and refreshingly original.","title":"Axiom Verge"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNarrative Grand Finale #This title stands as the climactic finale of one of gaming’s most intricate and ambitious storylines. The game unites the dual protagonists Kain and Raziel, whose intertwined fates have defined the Legacy of Kain series since its inception. For long-time fans, Defiance delivers a richly rewarding narrative payoff, a conclusion that ties up many of the saga’s philosophical and time-bending threads while maintaining the somber, gothic tone that has always defined the world of Nosgoth. The writing is poetic and grandiose, with themes of destiny, free will, and redemption explored through complex dialogue and powerful performances.\nAtmosphere and Mechanics #The voice acting elevates the experience to a level that was rarely seen in games of that era. Visually, it was a strong effort for its time, the environments brim with gothic architecture, atmospheric lighting, and haunting details that immerse the you in a decaying, cursed world. The transitions between the material and spectral realms, an iconic mechanic from the Soul Reaver games, are fluid and striking, reinforcing Raziel’s tragic existence as a creature caught between life and death. And while it is simpler compared to it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor, especially when it comes to puzzle-solving and platforming, it is still a satisfying mechanic to interact with.\nGameplay Shortcomings Exposed #Each location feels carefully crafted, contributing to a sense of history and decay that strengthens the storytelling. The gameplay, however, doesn’t quite live up to the narrative’s excellence, while you can finally control both Kain and Raziel in the same title, their combat styles feel more similar than they should. Kain’s brute force and blood-draining attacks contrast with Raziel’s spectral powers and puzzle-solving focus, but mechanically the two share too much overlap. Combat can become repetitive, with limited enemy variety and an overreliance on basic combos. The fixed camera angles are among the most common criticisms, often making battles disorienting and exploration frustrating.\nFlawed Yet Impactful #Combined with the lack of an in-game map or clear objectives, progression can sometimes feel more like a chore than an adventure. Despite these flaws, it succeeds where it matters most, delivering a satisfying end to a story that had spanned nearly a decade. The dialogue remains intelligent and philosophical, the atmosphere thick with gothic grandeur, and the character arcs of Kain and Raziel reach emotionally powerful conclusions. It’s a game that prioritizes storytelling over mechanical polish, offering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.\nFor Fans Only #For fans of the series, this game is essential, a dark, poetic farewell to two of gaming’s most memorable antiheroes. Newcomers may find its dated mechanics and awkward camera challenging, but those willing to push through will uncover one of the most narratively rich worlds in video game history. It’s an imperfect masterpiece, flawed in execution, but unforgettable in vision, and personally I would only recommend this for fans of the franchise, it most definitely can\u0026rsquo;t win any more fans at this point in the franchise\u0026rsquo;s story-line.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/legacy-of-kain-defiance/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title stands as the climactic finale of one of gaming’s most intricate and ambitious storylines.","title":"Legacy of Kain Defiance"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Model Sequel #The second mainline entry to the Max Payne franchise is a near-perfect example of how to build a sequel that respects its predecessor while deepening every aspect of its world, gameplay, and emotional weight. The game refines the original formula into something far more polished, cinematic, and narratively mature. Released in an era when story-driven shooters were still finding their footing, it stood out as a masterclass in noir storytelling and game design.\nNoir-Tinged Redemption #The MC is yet again Max Payne, a man still haunted by the ghosts of his past, caught between grief, guilt, and a longing for redemption. His reunion with Mona Sax, a mysterious contract killer, pulls him into a dark spiral of crime, conspiracy, and doomed love. The narrative is steeped in the language and style of classic film noir, hard-boiled monologues, shadowy alleyways, and moral ambiguity at every turn. As for the gameplay, it refines the original’s core mechanic, bullet time, into a smoother, more responsive system.\nCinematic Gunplay Mastery #Diving through gunfights in slow motion never loses its thrill, and the improved physics, make every bullet impact feel weighty and cinematic. The level design encourages creative combat, blending tight corridors with larger set pieces that showcase Remedy’s mastery of pacing. Even on repeated playthroughs, the combat remains satisfying, a blend of strategy and spectacle that was years ahead of its time. Visually, the game pushed the limits of what could be done back in the day, its gritty realism, moody lighting, and rain-drenched environments perfectly complement its melancholy tone.\nAtmosphere and Storytelling #The OST deepens the atmosphere with somber piano motifs and haunting ambient pieces that linger long after the credits roll. The story is told through beautifully drawn comic book panels, a signature stylistic choice from the first game that gives it a distinctive identity. These panels, paired with Max’s introspective narration, allow for a seamless blend of gameplay and storytelling, one that feels literary, cinematic, and deeply personal. The pacing is almost perfect, the game never overstays its welcome, delivering a complete and emotionally satisfying arc in roughly six to eight hours.\nA Lasting Masterpiece #This game is a tragic, beautifully written, and expertly crafted experience. It blends sharp storytelling, unforgettable atmosphere, and exhilarating gameplay into one of the most cohesive and emotionally charged shooters in gaming history. Even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, it remains a shining example of what happens when style and substance meet perfectly, a noir masterpiece that still hurts, and still dazzles.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/max-payne-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"A near-perfect example of how to build a sequel that respects its predecessor while deepening every aspect of its world.","title":"Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBalanced Final Chapter #This title brings the Sands of Time trilogy to a strong and satisfying close. After the darker and more violent tone of Warrior Within, this entry strikes a better balance between the emotional storytelling of the first game and the intense action of the second. The Prince returns to Babylon, only to find his kingdom in ruins and his past actions coming back to haunt him. What follows is a tightly woven tale of redemption, inner conflict, and fate. As for the gameplay, it refines the series’ signature mix of fluid platforming, acrobatics, and time manipulation.\nRefined Parkour Combat #The parkour sequences remain the highlight, leaping across walls, swinging from poles, and dodging deadly traps feels as smooth and rewarding as ever. Combat has been improved with the addition of the “Speed Kill” system, allowing for stealthy and cinematic takedowns. The introduction of the “Dark Prince,” a twisted version of the protagonist who uses a chain weapon and gradually loses health over time, adds an exciting layer of risk and variety to the experience. In my opinion this mechanic was not explored enough since the scale of this game was insanely small compared to Warrior Within, which in comparison, can even start to make it feel like the previous entry was almost an open-world metriodvania, even if it is not one.\nEmotional Trilogy Finale #Visually, the PlayStation 2 version shows the hardware’s limits, but the game’s art direction, moody lighting, and atmospheric OST help maintain a sense of grandeur. The story’s pacing, combined with a heartfelt ending, gives the trilogy a strong emotional closure. While occasional camera issues and some dated textures remain, it succeeds in blending action, puzzle-solving, and storytelling into a cohesive and memorable adventure, a fitting farewell to one of the most iconic heroes of the PS2 era.

The game was based on a lesser-known comic book series but quickly built its own identity through its mix of prehistoric and sci-fi elements. The MC is called Turok, a time-traveling Native American warrior tasked with stopping the evil Campaigner from using an ancient artifact to control the universe.\nScale, Exploration, Verticality #What made it so impressive back in the day was its sense of scale and atmosphere. The game featured large, open 3D environments filled with dinosaurs, mutants, and alien creatures, all rendered in a fluid 30 frames per second on hardware that was still new to 3D gaming. Its level design emphasized exploration and verticality, with hidden paths, keys, and portals scattered throughout. This encouraged you to backtrack and master the sprawling stages rather than simply blasting through them. It can even sometimes feel like a Metroidvania, since you need to huntdown key items in order to progress, about the only missing similarity is weapons and equipment which enables new areas.\nIconic Weapons and Flaws #The arsenal was another highlight, from the trusty bow and arrow to futuristic energy weapons, it offered a variety of tools that felt powerful and satisfying to use. The game’s fast movement, responsive controls, and fluid aiming system helped it stand out among early console shooters, even if the Nintendo 64’s single analog stick made precise aiming a challenge. That said, the game shows its age today, the notorious fog, used to hide the console’s limited draw distance, can make environments feel repetitive, and the platforming sequences are often clumsy. I recommend playing the modern re-releases since they have a lot of QOL improvements to enhance the experience, compared to the OG implementation.\nAmbitious, Influential Classic #Yet despite these flaws, this game remains an ambitious and influential title, it helped pave the way for later shooters on consoles, blending exploration, action, and atmosphere in a way few games of its time could match. Revisiting it today, whether on original hardware or through the remastered PC version, reveals a game that was ahead of its time, primitive in some ways, but bold in design and vision. This is one of the most unique shooters that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I don\u0026rsquo;t rank it higher simply because I played the original version, but the remaster is for sure the best way to experience this, and I would give it five stars if I ever play it.\n","date":"31 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/turok-dinosaur-hunter/","section":"Posts","summary":"A landmark release for the N64 and one of the first console FPSs to show that the genre could thrive outside of PC.","title":"Turok Dinosaur Hunter"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation Portable ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nA More Personal Kratos #This title is a remarkable entry in the legendary franchise, serving as an interquel between the original God of War and its sequel.

While the mainline titles often focused on large-scale vengeance and divine rebellion, Ghost of Sparta narrows its lens to deliver a character-driven tale that humanizes the Ghost of Sparta without softening his fury.\nOrigins, Family, Tragedy #The story begins with Kratos plagued by visions of his mortal past. His quest to uncover the truth leads him to Atlantis, the realm of Poseidon, and ultimately to a desperate attempt to rescue Deimos from the depths of the Domain of Death. This journey reveals more about Kratos’s origins, his mother Callisto, and the tragic fate of his family, themes that add emotional weight rarely seen in handheld action games. Despite being designed for a portable system, the game’s narrative pacing, voice acting, and cutscenes maintain the cinematic quality expected from the franchise, blending mythological grandeur with personal tragedy.\nConsole-Quality Portable Combat #It really doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a handheld portable game to play on-the-go, but rather a complete narrative gaming experience worth of regular consoles. As for the gameplay, it perfects the formula established by its predecessors. Combat is fast, responsive, and brutally satisfying, with a variety of combos and abilities that make each encounter feel dynamic. The introduction of new weapons, such as the Arms of Sparta, a spear and shield combination, adds tactical depth to the familiar blade-based combat. And particularly this weapon is my favorite of the entire franchise, it really makes you feel like a true spartan since this was the historically accurate weaponry that they used.\nCreative Magic and Spectacle #Magic abilities like the Eye of Atlantis and Scourge of Erinys bring creative variety to fights, ensuring that you never feel repetitive even through the most intense battles. Boss fights are another highlight, combining challenge, spectacle, and quick-time events in a way that only God of War can deliver, again, similar experience to the regular consoles. The PSP’s hardware limitations never seem to hinder the experience, instead, it showcases stunning visuals with detailed environments, smooth animations, and large-scale set pieces that rival those on home consoles of its era. Performance remains impressively stable, maintaining fluidity even during the most chaotic sequences.\nMinor Flaws, Major Impact #There are minor flaws, of course, the fixed camera can occasionally make platforming cumbersome, and the relatively short playtime (around six hours) leaves you wanting more. The game’s pacing, variety of locations, and satisfying sense of progression ensure that the adventure feels complete and memorable. In the end, this game is a shining example of what can be achieved on handheld hardware when technical ambition meets masterful design. It delivers visceral action, a compelling emotional arc, and the mythic spectacle the series is known for. Definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, or for fans of Hack\u0026rsquo;n Slash in general.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/god-of-war-ghost-of-sparta/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title serves as an interquel between the original God of War and its sequel.","title":"God of War Ghost of Sparta"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nCharming Retro Adventure #This title is a love letter to the classic top-down action-adventure of the 16-bit era, drawing clear inspiration from titles like ALTTP. Set on a charming archipelago, the game invites you to explore a vibrant world filled with secrets, side quests, and hidden treasures. Each island has its own character, from bustling towns to eerie caves, giving a sense of a living, breathing world despite its pixel-art simplicity. The visuals are bright and colorful, evoking nostalgia while still feeling fresh, and the OST complements the exploration perfectly with catchy, atmospheric melodies.\nExploration-Driven Gameplay #Gameplay centers on exploration, combat, and item-based progression. You wield swords, bows, and bombs, and can upgrade their abilities, craft items, and forage for resources. The dungeon designs are clever, providing puzzles and combat challenges that reward curiosity and experimentation. There’s a satisfying sense of progression as new tools and abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas, encouraging backtracking and thorough exploration. Many people have praised the balance of challenge and accessibility, noting that the game captures the essence of classic top-down action-adventure while adding its own charming touches.\nMinor Flaws Noted #However, some people report that controls can feel slightly stiff, especially in combat-heavy moments, and the map system is sometimes insufficient for navigation, leading to minor frustration in larger areas. Certain difficulty spikes in dungeons can feel abrupt, and while the game is engaging, its short length means the adventure can be completed relatively quickly. Despite these issues, the overall experience remains enjoyable, particularly for fans of retro-inspired indie games seeking a relaxing yet engaging adventure.\nNostalgic, Rewarding Journey #Ultimately, this game succeeds in evoking nostalgia while providing a charming, accessible top-down action-adventure experience for modern audiences. It may not reinvent the genre, but it delivers a delightful journey across its islands, full of secrets, exploration, and lighthearted adventure. For people who love classic top-down action-adventure, it’s a solid and rewarding experience. It is worth a try if you enjoy the games which inspired it such as Alundra and the already mentioned ALTTP.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ocean-heart/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a love letter to the classic top-down action-adventure of the 16-bit era.","title":"Ocean's Heart"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nPsychological Depth Unleashed #The third mainline entry to the Silent Hill franchise is one of the most mature and psychologically unsettling entries in the survival horror genre. It continues the series trademark focus on atmosphere, symbolism, and emotional depth, while delivering one of the strongest narratives in the franchise. And as much as I wished to elaborate on the main plot\u0026rsquo;s topic, it would be a shame to present spoilers, all I can say now is that it has the same level of quality as it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors. The MC is called Heather Mason, a teenage girl whose ordinary day at a shopping mall spirals into a descent through nightmarish, blood-soaked worlds. What begins as a personal journey quickly evolves into a disturbing exploration of identity, grief, and inherited trauma, ultimately tying back to the events of the first Silent Hill.\nHeather’s Human Complexity #Heather’s vulnerability, sarcasm, and humanity make her one of the most relatable and well-written protagonists in horror gaming. This is truly one of this biggest standouts compared to the previous titles, especially because the protagonist is younger this time around, making it more relatable to certain demographics in gaming. Visually, it was a technical showcase for the PlayStation 2. The use of lighting, fog, and detailed environments creates a constant sense of dread. From filthy hospital corridors to rust-covered amusement parks, every location feels alive with corruption and despair. This title is definitely the most varied one when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s environments and world, feeling like yet another element that was improved from previous entries.\nSound as Terror #The OST and ambient design elevate the experience to something truly haunting. The industrial noises, distorted radio static, and melancholic melodies perfectly mirror Heather’s emotional state and the decaying world around her. Few games use sound as effectively to manipulate mood and tension like this one does. Gameplay adheres to the series traditional structure, exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. In my opinion this game has more combat than previous mainline entries, almost all rooms have at least one enemy for you to face. The clunky controls and limited camera are sometimes criticized, but they serve the atmosphere, making every encounter feel dangerous and every step uncertain.\nRefined Horror Mastery #The puzzles range from logical to cryptic, demanding careful observation and thought rather than brute force. Though it doesn’t reinvent the formula, this game refines it beautifully. The pacing, story, and psychological intensity make it arguably the last truly great entry from Team Silent before the series later decline. This title is a masterclass in psychological horror, disturbing, elegant, and emotionally resonant. Its layered storytelling, unforgettable visuals. This is definitely a must-play since it is a landmark of how polished this genre managed to get in the PlayStation 2 platform, and one of the best ones of all time.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/silent-hill-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is one of the most mature and psychologically unsettling entries in the survival horror genre.","title":"Silent Hill 3"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nMinimalist Boss Focus #This title is an action game, often described as a “Souls-like boss rush.” Instead of exploring vast worlds or gathering loot, the game narrows its focus to a series of intense boss encounters, each representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins. This minimalist design gives it a unique rhythm, there’s no filler, no side quests, just pure combat and consequence. Its defining mechanic is that, before each fight, the protagonist must sacrifice a part of his strength. Health, stamina, defense, and even healing items are gradually stripped away, meaning that as you progress, your character grows weaker rather than stronger. It’s a bold inversion of traditional RPG progression that fits perfectly with the game’s themes of guilt, redemption, and punishment.\nPrecision-Driven Combat #The combat itself borrows heavily from Dark Souls, emphasizing deliberate movement, stamina management, and punishing precision. Each boss presents a distinct challenge, from fast and agile foes to towering monstrosities that fill the arena. Mastery comes from learning their attack patterns and exploiting small openings, which creates moments of real satisfaction when a long-fought victory is finally earned. The boss designs, both visually and mechanically, show care and variety, giving each fight its own identity despite the game’s small scope. I dare to say they rival bosses from the Dark Souls series.\nSparse Worldbuilding Issues #Visually, it adopts a dark, desaturated art style that complements its somber tone, but it lacks the atmosphere and world-building depth of its inspirations. The minimalist environments can feel empty, and the OST, though serviceable, rarely elevates the tension in meaningful ways. The storytelling is deliberately cryptic, offering glimpses of lore through brief dialogues and item descriptions, yet never developing the emotional or narrative weight that could have tied the journey together. While this approach may appeal to fans of sparse storytelling, others may find it too detached to be memorable.\nStriking but Short-Lived #It’s the kind of title that challenges you for a few hours, delivers its message, and ends before its mechanics wear thin. Ultimately, this game stands out as a creative but uneven experiment within the Souls-like genre. Its core idea, growing weaker with every victory, is brilliant in theory and effective in execution, turning each new boss fight into a test of adaptation and perseverance. Yet the limited scope, lack of progression, and uneven presentation hold it back from greatness. For people who enjoy difficult combat and thematic minimalism, it’s worth a look. But those seeking rich worlds, intricate lore, and long-term depth may find the experience too fleeting.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an action game, often described as a \u0026lsquo;Souls-like boss rush.\u0026rsquo;","title":"Sinner Sacrifice for Redemption"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 70 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAmbitious 90s RPG #This title is one of the most ambitious and memorable RPGs of the late 1990s. It stands out for its intricate storytelling, rich character development, and unique dual-layered combat system that blends traditional turn-based battles with mech-based \u0026ldquo;Gear\u0026rdquo; fights. The MC is called Fei Fong Wong, an amnesiac young man who becomes entangled in a vast and mysterious conflict spanning nations, ancient technology, and shadowy organizations. As the story unfolds, themes of identity, fate, religion, and human consciousness are explored with surprising depth for a video game of its era.\nExpansive World-Building #The world-building in Xenogears is expansive, the game introduces you to a variety of cultures, political intrigues, and moral dilemmas, giving a sense of scale and complexity that rivals even modern RPGs. The characters are equally compelling, Fei’s personal struggles are mirrored by the journeys of those around him, each with their own flaws, secrets, and motivations. The narrative does not shy away from mature and philosophical topics, making it a thought-provoking experience that resonates long after the credits roll. This one is indeed one of the golden era JRPG titles similar to FFVII, FFVI and both Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross games from back in the day.\nDual-Layered Combat #The gameplay is multi-layered, on the surface, standard turn-based combat is solid and satisfying, with a strong emphasis on timed button presses to chain attacks and unleash combos. However, the standout feature is Gear combat, where you pilot giant mechs in tactical battles that feel both powerful and strategic. This dual-layered system adds depth and variety, keeping combat engaging throughout much of the game. Some mechanics, such as random encounters and extensive menu navigation, may feel cumbersome by today’s standards, but they were typical of the era.\nMemorable OST and Visuals #The OST is another highlight, ranging from emotional piano pieces to epic orchestral tracks, perfectly complementing the game’s dramatic moments. And this is not an unique trait of this title, it is indeed one of the best OSTs that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, and this is a common thing when it comes to JRPGs in general. Visually, the game blends 2D sprite-based characters with 3D environments, creating a distinctive style that still has charm today, even if it shows its age. I loved this aesthetic back in the day, started with titles such as Resident Evil, and I wished more games used this feature nowadays.\nFlawed Final Act #The game’s major criticism lies in its pacing and storytelling toward the end. Due to time and budget constraints, some plot elements are delivered through long text sequences rather than fully animated cutscenes, which can feel overwhelming. This is definitely one of the worst aspects of this title, I knew it before playing it for the first time, but I never thought it would be so bad as people made it out to be, and unfortunately, it is even worse than I thought. Despite this, the ending is still emotionally impactful and leaves a lasting impression.\nTimeless Narrative Masterpiece #Overall, this game is a masterpiece of narrative-driven RPG design. Its combination of deep storytelling, compelling characters, philosophical themes, and innovative combat make it a must-play for fans of classic role-playing games. While not perfect, it’s a game that remains influential and beloved decades after its release. It\u0026rsquo;ll continue to influence other titles of today\u0026rsquo;s JRPG modern games, one of them which I highly recommend is Chained Echoes, which has a similar two-layered combat system, quite similar to Xenogears. This game is definitely a must-play for fans of RPGs in general, not just of JRPGs, it is one of the best games of all time in my opinion, despite the last sections being one of the worst gaming experiences I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\n","date":"30 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/xenogears/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of the most ambitious and memorable RPGs of the late 1990s.","title":"Xenogears"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nNarrative-Driven Horror Shift #This second Amnesia entry is a first-person psychological horror game, it game shifts away from the mechanics-heavy survival horror of its predecessor and ventures into a more narrative-driven, atmospheric experience. Set in Victorian-era London at the dawn of the 20th century, the MC is called Oswald Mandus, who awakens in his mansion with fragmented memories, haunted by feverish visions and the cries of his missing children. Drawn into the bowels of his estate and beyond, Mandus discovers a massive, nightmarish machine beneath the city, one that reflects the monstrous consequences of human ambition and industrial greed.\nAtmosphere Over Mechanics #From the moment it begins, it envelops you in a suffocating sense of dread, with moody writing, audio logs, and gradual revelations. The game abandons traditional survival mechanics, there’s no inventory, no sanity meter, and no oil or tinderboxes to worry about. Instead, it emphasizes immersion through environmental storytelling and sound design. And this is what separate the community the most, since this sequel felt more like a walking-simulator than a survival horror game, since it removed the beloved elements of the more traditional first entry to the series. The lighting and level design reinforce this atmosphere, blending gothic architecture with the grim aesthetics of factories, slaughterhouses, and catacombs to create a world that feels both human and inhuman at once.\nPsychological Focused Terror #While this change in design philosophy alienated some fans of the original Amnesia, it also gave the game a unique identity. The horror here is more psychological than mechanical, it’s rooted in Mandus’s guilt and the philosophical implications of his actions rather than constant jump scares or direct threats. The story builds slowly, and while enemy encounters are sparse, their rarity amplifies the tension when they finally occur. Despite its strengths, the game’s simplification of gameplay systems was divisive. The puzzles are simple, the exploration limited, and the sense of danger less constant than in The Dark Descent.\nBold but Flawed Experiment #In the end, this game stands as a bold, if controversial, reinterpretation of what horror can be. It replaces the frantic terror of its predecessor with slow-burning dread and philosophical unease. Though it may not deliver the same level of mechanical depth or intensity, it offers something more cerebral, a tragic, gothic meditation on invention, morality, and the human cost of progress. As much as I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Amnesia, and survival horror in general, I simply cannot recommend this title, it is no a very good experience and not worth the time, even though it is quite a short game.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs/","section":"Posts","summary":"This sequel shifts from the mechanics-heavy survival horror, into a more narrative-driven, atmospheric experience.","title":"Amnesia A Machine for Pigs"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nBrutal Melee Focus #This title is a first-person melee action game, it combines a heavy-metal aesthetic with “souls-like” combat mechanics and old-school level design, focusing entirely on close-quarters combat rather than ranged attacks. The game’s atmosphere is distinct, brutal, stylish, and drenched in metal music, giving it a unique tone that stands out among other indie titles of its era. The combat is the clear highlight, weapons feel heavy, strikes are satisfying, and timing your attacks, parries, and dodges brings a rewarding sense of rhythm. A lot of people praised how the gameplay feels impactful once you master the mechanics.\nLinear but Stylish #The world design, while linear, has a handcrafted charm, and the OST complements the action perfectly. The overall experience is concise, lasting around eight to ten hours, which works in its favor by keeping the pacing tight. On the downside, Elderborn can feel repetitive due to limited enemy variety and occasionally awkward level design. Some people found the combat animations a bit clunky, and the story is minimal, more a backdrop than a driving force. It’s a game that lives and dies by its combat system, and if you don’t click with its melee focus, there isn’t much else to keep you engaged.\nA Short Hidden Gem #Overall, this game is a solid indie experience for fans of skill-based, first-person melee combat. It’s stylish, fast and even if a bit rough around the edges. For people seeking a short but intense action fix, it’s a hidden gem worth checking out, a focused. If you even remotely like the idea of a brutal first-person melee game than you can\u0026rsquo;t find a better one than this. I would also recommend this for fans of the Soulslike genre since it has all of it\u0026rsquo;s elements, despite the heavy change of gameplay perspective, it still feels like one.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/elderborn/","section":"Posts","summary":"A first-person melee action game, it combines a heavy-metal aesthetic with “souls-like” combat.","title":"Elderborn"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nFrozen World Warfare #This title is a third-person shooter set on the frozen planet E.D.N. III, where humanity battles both the harsh climate and giant insect-like creatures known as the Akrid. The game’s icy setting gives it a distinctive atmosphere, with blizzards, crumbling bases, and vast snowy plains rendered impressively for its time. The use of thermal energy as both a survival mechanic and gameplay resource adds tension, forcing you to stay aggressive in order to stay alive. Combat feels dynamic, especially when piloting the massive “Vital Suits,” which let you wield heavy weapons and battle towering bosses.\nSpectacle With Flaws #The enemy designs and scale of encounters often feel cinematic, giving a sense of constant danger and spectacle. However, despite the strong presentation, the game suffers from repetitive mission structures and uneven pacing, with levels that can feel linear and overly similar. The story, centered on revenge and corporate conspiracies, serves more as a backdrop than a driving force. Despite its flaws, this game remains a memorable action experience thanks to its unique setting and ambitious visuals, even if its gameplay loop doesn’t quite live up to its striking premise.\nUnderrated Franchise Legacy #It was one of the last games that I played on my very first computer, and it ran very poorly, but I struggled through the low-FPS count from start to finish because I was thrilled with the gameplay, especially when it comes to the mecha feature. This is one of the most unique Capcom\u0026rsquo;s titles and I wished this franchise had more care and love by it\u0026rsquo;s developers. Unfortunately they let this great idea die out after three entries, in which the 3rd one felt more like a Dead Space clone than an actual Lost Planet entry.

It continues the story of Zero, a legendary Reploid warrior battling against Neo Arcadia in a war-torn future where the line between hero and villain has become blurred. Unlike its predecessors, Zero 3 brings a smoother difficulty curve, a more accessible upgrade system, and an enhanced sense of pacing that keeps the action engaging without overwhelming newcomers. And this is a downer for me because I quite enjoy the higher difficulty levels of the predecessors to this entry.\nTight, Evolved Gameplay #As for the gameplay, the controls feel incredibly tight and responsive, a hallmark of the series, but this installment perfects the formula. The addition of the Recoil Rod, a new weapon capable of attacking enemies at close range or propelling Zero to higher platforms, adds a layer of mobility and versatility to combat. The returning weapons, like the Z-Saber and Buster Shot, are as satisfying as ever, rewarding precision and skill. Levels are more thoughtfully designed, with better checkpoints and fewer moments of cheap difficulty, making each mission feel fair yet challenging.\nImproved Cyber Elf System #The Cyber Elf system, a unique feature in the Zero series, receives one of its best overhauls here. Instead of punishing players for using Cyber Elves (small helper programs that grant bonuses), it introduces a subtler customization approach through the new “Satellite” system. This allows for strategic benefits without sacrificing rank, encouraging experimentation and adding meaningful variety to gameplay styles. This was a needed addition since the gameplay is somewhat simplistic compared to the non-hand-held entries to the franchise, which are not very complex to begin with.\nStriking Visuals and Sound #Visually, the game is a showcase of what the GBA could do at its peak, the sprite work is remarkably detailed, animations are smooth, and environments burst with atmosphere, from the metallic corridors of enemy bases to the desolate wastelands that set the tone of Zero’s bleak world. The OST, full of high-energy electronic rock, amplifies the intensity of battle while evoking a sense of melancholy fitting for its dystopian setting, despite not being as good as the mainline OSTs, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint. Beyond its technical achievements, it excels in storytelling, it deepens the lore of the Mega Man universe, exploring themes of identity, loyalty, and the cost of war.\nPersonal, High-Stakes Narrative #The narrative feels more personal, showing Zero as both a soldier and a symbol of resistance. Its boss fights are memorable not only for their creative design but also for how they reflect the game’s moral and emotional stakes, displaying dialogs at the beginning of each fight, to bring some meaning to the things happening in the background. Overall, this game captures the essence of classic Mega Man while pushing it forward with maturity and polish. It’s a near-perfect blend of speed, precision, and style, a definitive action-platformer for the GBA and a high point for the Zero saga.\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-zero-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title entry stands as one of the most refined and polished entries in the entire Mega Man franchise.","title":"Mega Man Zero 3"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nDual-Protagonist Stealth Focus #This Tenchu etry is a stealth-action game that continues the dark, atmospheric tradition of the Tenchu series, set in feudal Japan. This installment shifts focus to two female protagonists, Ayame, a returning assassin from previous games, and Rin, a streetwise newcomer seeking revenge. The dual storyline is one of the game’s stronger elements, offering contrasting perspectives and a bit more narrative depth than past entries. Gameplay remains centered on stealth, patience, and precision, missions reward silent kills and careful planning, allowing you to perform cinematic stealth kills that feel brutal and satisfying.\nAging Design Limitations #The environments, small villages, forests, and fortresses, are well designed for sneaking, though the level layouts can feel repetitive. The addition of cooperative stealth kills and non-lethal takedowns gives some welcome variety to the formula. Unfortunately, this game also shows its age, the graphics and animations look dated even for 2004, and the camera and control scheme can be frustrating in tight spaces.\nFlawed but Atmospheric Stealth #Enemy AI is inconsistent, sometimes sharp, other times oblivious, and this undermines the sense of tension that defines a great stealth game.

The game features four classic heroes, the Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf, each offering distinct playstyles that encourage teamwork. The Warrior is all about brute strength and close-range combat, the Valkyrie balances offense and defense with her shield, the Wizard combines elemental spells in a system reminiscent of Magicka, and the Elf focuses on speed and ranged attacks.\nDiverse Hero Playstyles #Particularly I liked the Warrior and the Valkyrie the most, and was highly intrigued to try to master the Wizard, but even though I played through the entirety of Magicka 1 and 2, I couldnt even begin to understand this character. The Wizard is definitely the most complex one to play, and the most powerful at the same time, it almost has limitless effectiveness because of how flexible his playstyle is. This diversity keeps combat fresh, especially in multiplayer, where coordination becomes essential for survival. Visually, the game uses a clean, dark fantasy aesthetic that fits its dungeon-crawling roots.\nChaotic Dungeon Action #Levels are filled with hordes of enemies, gold, traps, and destructible objects, keeping the action frantic and rewarding. The tongue-in-cheek narrator adds personality and humor, poking fun at players’ mistakes or greed in a way that pays homage to the arcade original’s taunts (“Wizard needs food, badly!”). Despite these strengths, Gauntlet can become repetitive. The level design relies heavily on similar enemy waves and room layouts, and the progression system, focused on collecting gold to unlock relics or upgrades, can feel grindy over time.\nBest With Friends #Solo play also lacks the chaotic energy that makes co-op so enjoyable, emphasizing that the game is best experienced with friends, either locally or online. I played through the campaign mostly solo, but I sometimes play with a friend and I highly recommend doing so, it is a much more enjoyable experience, though playing alone is also pretty much viable. This game succeeds as a faithful, fast-paced revival that thrives on cooperative mayhem. It’s a blast for short sessions with friends but doesn’t quite have the variety or depth to sustain long-term solo play.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/gauntlet/","section":"Posts","summary":"A modern reimagining of the beloved 1985 arcade classic, it preserves the chaotic, cooperative dungeon-crawling spirit.","title":"Gauntlet"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCompanionship and Survival #This title is a psychological survival horror game that stands out for its haunting atmosphere and unique companion mechanics. The MC is called Fiona Belli, a young woman who wakes up trapped inside a gothic castle after a car accident. Isolated and defenseless, she must rely on her companion, a dog named Hewie, to explore the castle, solve puzzles, and evade relentless pursuers. The relationship between Fiona and Hewie is central to the experience, with trust and obedience shaping how effectively he can help you survive.\nOppressive Horror Atmosphere #The game’s greatest strength lies in its tension and atmosphere. The eerie castle feels oppressive and alive, filled with unsettling details and threatening stalkers who pursue Fiona with disturbing persistence. The panic system, which distorts the screen and controls when Fiona is frightened, is an inspired touch that immerses the player in her vulnerability. Visually, it makes impressive use of the PS2’s hardware, delivering realistic environments and lighting that amplify the dread.\nSlow, Tense Gameplay #However, the game’s structure can become repetitive, cycling through a pattern of being hunted, hiding, and solving puzzles. The pacing is deliberate and slow, which enhances tension but may frustrate players expecting faster action. Though if you come to this game expecting something like modern Resident Evil, than this one is not for you, this title is even slower than the very first RE entry, which is great for fans of oldschool survival horror. The controls are somewhat stiff, and while the story’s premise is intriguing, it doesn’t always deliver deep character development or a strong narrative payoff.\nCult Horror Classic #Despite these flaws, this game remains a memorable and underrated entry in the survival horror genre.

The redesigned levels preserve the soul of the 1996 maps while adding new layers of complexity and visual beauty.\nRefined Yet Classic #Lara controls fluidly compared to the original’s grid-based movement, though some people may find the camera and platforming imprecise by today’s standards. Combat remains secondary, with a limited set of enemies and basic lock-on gunplay, but it never overstays its welcome. Instead, the game shines in moments of solitude, when you’re alone in a vast, echoing tomb, solving a mechanism that’s lain dormant for centuries.\nAtmospheric Tomb Adventure #The OST and atmosphere enhance this sense of mystery and adventure. The music subtly shifts between quiet tension and triumphant discovery, perfectly complementing the game’s rhythm of exploration and revelation. Visually, Anniversary still holds up decently on PC, with detailed architecture and strong lighting that make each environment feel alive. Overall, this game succeeds as both a tribute and a refinement. It bridges the gap between the old-school design of the ’90s and the cinematic presentation of the 2000s.\nTimeless Franchise Tribute #For longtime fans, it’s a nostalgic journey reimagined with respect; for newcomers, it’s a beautifully crafted introduction to what Tomb Raider truly meant back in the day, adventure, intelligence, and discovery. This is definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, or if you like similar titles. I remember this blowing my mind when I realized that games could be remade into new versions, and then the RE titles followed suit and nowadays we have a lot of them to play around with.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lara-croft-tomb-raider-anniversary/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a respectful and skillful remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider.","title":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nEpic 16-Bit Warfare #This title is a standout example of how far developers could push the SNES near the end of its lifespan. The game delivers a thrilling mix of precision platforming, intense action, and clever mech-based gameplay. The MC is called Stone, a soldier fighting against the Dark Axis forces in a desperate war for Earth’s survival. While the plot is fairly simple, the atmosphere and presentation make the conflict feel epic, especially for a 16-bit title.\nInnovative Mech Gameplay #What truly sets the game apart is its unique gameplay loop. You pilot various mechs, each with distinct weapons, mobility, and combat styles, from the balanced Nitro unit to the heavy Prometheus or the flight-capable Havoc. Impressively, you can eject from your mech at any time to explore small passages or hijack enemy suits, adding a layer of strategy uncommon in action games of that era. This mechanic keeps gameplay fresh and dynamic, blending exploration and combat seamlessly.\nPolished Action Design #The controls are crisp and responsive, with satisfying weapon feedback and fluid animations. The level design encourages experimentation, rewarding people who learn to use each mech’s strengths effectively. Graphically, the game is stunning, detailed environments, smooth animation, and explosive effects that rival even some early 32-bit titles. The OST complements the action with a gritty, futuristic tone that enhances the immersion.\nChallenging Yet Replayable #It is also notable for its two-player split-screen versus mode, a rare feature that adds considerable replayability, in which I poured a couple of hours into with some friends back in the day. However, the game is challenging, limited continues, tough enemies, and minimal guidance make it demanding even for experienced people. I admit that I could only manage to beat this title while using save-states via emulation, it is sometimes an unbalanced experience.\nAmbitious SNES Classic #Despite its difficulty and limited availability at release, this game has since become a cult classic. It’s one of the most technically and creatively ambitious titles on the SNES, and to this day, it stands as a testament to LucasArts’ innovation and mastery of the 16-bit platform. It is a no-brainer since it is very short, there is little to no excuse not to play this if you enjoy other similar games of this era.\n","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-warriors/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a standout example of how far developers could push the SNES near the end of its lifespan.","title":"Metal Warriors"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nSurprisingly Clever Disney Game #This title is one of those rare licensed games that went far beyond expectations, the game blends lighthearted Disney charm with surprisingly clever gameplay design. Based loosely on the animated TV series of the same name, it sees Goofy and his son Max stranded on Spoonerville Island after pirates kidnap their neighbors Pete and PJ. What follows is a five-stage adventure full of puzzles, exploration, and slapstick humor.\nPuzzle-Action Gameplay #At its core, it plays a lot like a lighter, cooperative take on Zelda ALTTP. You move room to room solving block puzzles, collecting items like keys, grappling hooks, and candles, and tossing barrels or objects to defeat enemies. The mechanics are simple but extremely well-tuned, and the game’s balance between action and puzzle-solving keeps it engaging from start to finish. While Goofy is stronger but slower, Max moves faster but can’t push heavy blocks, a small but effective distinction that adds to the cooperative strategy when playing with a friend.\nCooperative Play Highlights #The two-player mode is where the game shines, coordination between players is essential, one can distract enemies while the other solves puzzles or grabs items, making the experience feel dynamic and social. I played this alone and I highly recommend doing so if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a friend to tag along, the experience is still enjoyable. Even in single-player, the AI and level design hold up well, but there’s something uniquely fun about the shared laughter and mild chaos of local co-op sessions, plus you don\u0026rsquo;t even need the AI, you can go full solo.\nVibrant Presentation, Short Length #Visually, it is vibrant and detailed, capturing the feel of the cartoon with expressive sprites and lush tropical backgrounds. The OST, full of upbeat island tunes and catchy melodies, perfectly matches the lighthearted tone, similar to other Disney titles of the SNES era. Its only real drawback is its short length, with just five stages, most people can finish the game in a couple of hours. Yet, its charm, replay value, and tight design make it one of the most underrated gems of the SNES library. This game proves that even a Disney license can deliver something timeless when handled by a studio that truly understands gameplay.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/goof-troop/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game blends lighthearted Disney charm with surprisingly clever gameplay design.","title":"Goof Troop"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRetro-Inspired 2D Platformer #This title is a lovingly crafted 2D platformer that channels the energy and spirit of the 1990s with remarkable authenticity. It draws clear inspiration from genre greats like Donkey Kong Country and Rayman, but manages to carve out its own charm through sharp design and an endearing presentation. The MC is called Kaze, a brave rabbit who embarks on a quest to save her friend Hogo from a mysterious curse that has corrupted the Crystal Islands. The premise is simple and intentionally retro, setting the stage for a series of challenging, tightly designed levels that feel like a direct homage to the golden era of side-scrolling platformers. I\u0026rsquo;m a little biased since the studio behind this title is from Brazil, but I sincerely think this is one of the best indies that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played.\nFluid, Varied Gameplay #Gameplay is where it truly shines, the controls are precise and responsive, allowing for fluid movement and quick reactions, an essential trait for a game that frequently tests your timing and platforming precision. Each stage introduces new mechanics or obstacles, keeping the pace lively and avoiding repetition. The “Wild Masks” mechanic adds welcome variety, letting you temporarily adopt new animal forms such as a tiger that sprints up walls, a shark that swims swiftly underwater, an eagle that glides through aerial levels, and a lizard that dashes through auto-run sections. These transformations not only diversify the gameplay but also infuse the adventure with a sense of discovery and excitement, as you adapt to new styles of movement and combat.\nVibrant Visuals and Music #Visually, the game is a delight, its hand-drawn pixel art is bursting with color and detail, capturing lush jungles, eerie ruins, and shimmering underwater zones with impressive craftsmanship. Animations are smooth and expressive, giving both Kaze and her enemies personality. The OST complements the visuals perfectly, offering upbeat melodies and atmospheric tunes that shift naturally with each environment. Together, these elements create a sense of warmth and familiarity that’s both nostalgic and fresh, as if you’re playing a lost SNES classic that’s been remade with modern polish.\nRetro Design Challenges #Despite all its strengths, this title isn’t without its flaws, its devotion to retro design means it doesn’t break much new ground; many of its ideas and level structures will feel instantly recognizable to seasoned platformer fans. The game’s difficulty can also be punishing, especially in later levels or bonus challenges, relying on memorization and split-second timing. I admit that I consider myself a platforming veteran but I still struggled trying to play the end-game levels. Some people might find this frustrating, while others will see it as a rewarding callback to the tough-but-fair standards of 90s gaming.\nCraftsmanship and Heart #Ultimately, this title Wild Masks succeeds because of its craftsmanship and heart. It doesn’t try to reinvent the genre, but rather celebrates it with confidence and precision. Every jump, enemy placement, and power-up feels carefully considered, and the game radiates a clear love for the classics that inspired it. For people who grew up on 16-bit adventures, like myself, or anyone craving a polished, challenging platformer with timeless appeal, this game is a hidden gem that deserves attention. This is definitely a must-play if you like platformers to any extent, and obviously if you like the games that inspired this one. I recommend doing 100% since it is a very short and simple title, and it feels like it was made with this intention in mind.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kaze-and-the-wild-masks/","section":"Posts","summary":"A lovingly crafted 2D platformer that channels the energy and spirit of the 1990s with remarkable authenticity.","title":"Kaze and the Wild Masks"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 9 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNon-Linear Exploration Focus #This title is a distinctive entry in the Kirby series that experiments with non-linear exploration, setting it apart from previous Kirby titles. Instead of progressing through a strictly linear set of levels, you navigate a vast, interconnected mirrored world, filled with branching paths, secret areas, and hidden treasures. This design encourages you to explore thoroughly, rewarding curiosity and careful navigation with power-ups and secret collectibles.\nClassic Gameplay, Multiplayer Added #The game retains the classic Kirby formula of inhaling enemies to gain their abilities, offering a wide variety of powers that can be strategically combined to overcome obstacles. The combat is simple but satisfying, and the puzzles, though not overly complex, add a nice layer of variety to the gameplay. A major highlight is the introduction of cooperative multiplayer, which allows up to four players to join in simultaneously, each controlling a different colored Kirby. I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced the multiplayer feature so I can\u0026rsquo;t give much of a valuable opinion on this, I played this entirely alone, and it was still an enjoyable experience.\nCharming Visuals and Sound #Visually, the game is bright, colorful, and full of charm, with detailed sprite work that brings the mirrored world to life. The OST is lively and memorable, perfectly complementing the whimsical, adventurous tone of the game, similar to previous titles of this franchise. On the downside, the open-world structure can sometimes feel a bit aimless compared to the tight, level-based design of other Kirby games, and certain areas can become repetitive during extended play sessions.\nOpen-World Strengths and Weaknesses #It\u0026rsquo;s open-world is it\u0026rsquo;s biggest strength, and also it\u0026rsquo;s biggest weakness, it was not very well implemented, leading you to waste a couple of unnecessary hours lost in the navigation process. Overall, this game is a bold and enjoyable experiment in the series, its combination of open-ended exploration, classic Kirby gameplay, and multiplayer fun makes it a unique and memorable experience for both longtime fans and newcomers alike, offering a refreshing take on the pink puffball’s adventures.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/kirby-and-the-amazing-mirror/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title experiments with non-linear exploration, setting it apart from previous Kirby titles.","title":"Kirby \u0026 The Amazing Mirror"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Crime Drama #This title is a third-person, story-driven crime drama set in the fictional city of Empire Bay, a richly detailed world inspired by post-war America from the 1940s to the 1950s. The MC is called Vito Scaletta, a Sicilian-American war veteran who returns home after World War II, only to find himself entangled in the criminal underworld in search of money, power, and belonging. The narrative is the game’s greatest strength. It’s mature, cinematic, and grounded, focusing more on loyalty, betrayal, and family than over-the-top action. Vito’s journey, along with his hot-headed best friend Joe Barbaro, feels authentic and tragic, making the story feel like a playable gangster film.\nAuthentic Worldbuilding Excellence #The dialogue is sharp, the pacing is tight, and the voice acting, especially from Rick Pasqualone as Vito, is top-notch. Visually, it remains impressive for its time. The attention to detail in the cars, fashion, and architecture of Empire Bay captures the era’s mood perfectly, if you are a car enthusiast you\u0026rsquo;ll fall in love with this game solely because of it\u0026rsquo;s driving experience. The licensed soundtrack, featuring artists like Buddy Holly and Dean Martin, adds a ton of personality and helps immerse you in the world. In many ways this title has a similar quality level to the GTA titles, despite it\u0026rsquo;s scale being very small in comparison, and also not having as good of a sandbox, it still retains the world building and mainline plot quality level.\nLinear Yet Powerful #As for the gameplay, however, it definitely shows its limitations. The gunplay is competent but formulaic, and the open world, while beautiful, is surprisingly empty. There are no side missions or meaningful activities beyond the main story, which makes Empire Bay feel more like a backdrop than a living city. Still, the tight structure ensures that the narrative stays focused, avoiding unnecessary filler. Overall, this title stands out for its storytelling, atmosphere, and cinematic presentation rather than its mechanics. It’s a game that values mood and narrative depth over sandbox freedom. This title is a stylish, emotional crime saga that feels like a love letter to classic mob cinema, beautiful, moody, and unforgettable, even if it’s more linear than open-world.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mafia-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A game with richly detailed world inspired by post-war America from the 1940s to the 1950s.","title":"Mafia II"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nChallenging Action-Platformer Revival #This title is an action-platformer that serves as a spiritual successor to Ghosts ’n Goblins. The game challenges you with tight combat, precise platforming, and a high difficulty level that rewards persistence and skill. Its core mechanics of sword combat, armor management, and exploration are solid, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment when progressing through tough levels. I admit that I abused the save-state feature in order to complete and 100% this one, no shame since it is an insanely punishing title, similar to it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor.\nCharming Visuals and Sound #The visual style is charming, with colorful environments, skeletal enemies, and a humorous armor system where Maximo loses his armor after taking damage. It really makes you feel like you are playing a 3D version of the 2D titles from the previous console generations, this shows that you can still retain a consistent art-style despite the technology being used. The game’s presentation adds personality and keeps the action engaging, while the sound design and music complement the old-school arcade feel. The game also encourages replayability due to its challenging nature and strategic item usage, I advise this title is played 100% because of it\u0026rsquo;s short length, despite it stretching it because of it\u0026rsquo;s difficulty level.\nDifficulty and Design Flaws #However, the high difficulty can be punishing, especially for modern people used to frequent checkpoints and forgiving gameplay (easily solved by using save-states). Some camera angles and control quirks occasionally make combat and platforming frustrating, and the level design, while competent, can feel repetitive after extended play. Despite these issues, the challenge and nostalgic design make it appealing to fans of retro-inspired action games. Overall, this game is a rewarding experience for people who enjoy old-school difficulty and precise platforming. It is a standout PS2 title for those seeking a challenging adventure with personality, even if it demands patience and skill to fully appreciate.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/maximo-ghosts-to-glory/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an action-platformer that serves as a spiritual successor to Ghosts \u0026rsquo;n Goblins.","title":"Maximo Ghosts to Glory"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nModern Stealth Revival #This title is a bold attempt to revive the beloved stealth franchise for a modern audience. The MC is called Garrett, a master thief navigating a dark, industrial city rife with corruption, social inequality, and mysterious supernatural forces. The game leans heavily into stealth mechanics, encouraging careful planning, patience, and creative use of gadgets like water arrows, rope arrows, and the trusty blackjack to incapacitate foes without raising alarms. Shadows and light play a critical role, making the environment itself a key part of gameplay strategy.\nMoody, Immersive World #Visually, Thief delivers a moody, immersive world. The city is filled with narrow alleys, towering rooftops, and richly detailed interiors, all bathed in an atmospheric mix of torchlight and fog. Sound design further enhances the tension, with creaking floors, distant guards, and ambient noises creating a constant sense of unease. However, while the setting is impressive, the story falls short compared to earlier entries. Garrett’s motivations are often underdeveloped, and the narrative, though engaging at times, struggles to maintain momentum across missions.\nStealth Gameplay Strengths/Weaknesses #As for the gameplay, the focus on stealth is both a strength and a weakness. Many missions reward careful, methodical play, but some sections feel repetitive, and enemy AI can be inconsistent, sometimes clever and unpredictable, other times easily exploitable. Combat is intentionally weak to reinforce stealth, but this can frustrate people who prefer a more balanced approach.\nFalls Short Overall #This game succeeds in creating a tense, atmospheric stealth experience, but it cannot honor the spirit of the original series. It shines in its environmental design and stealth mechanics, but a thin story and occasional gameplay inconsistencies prevent it from fully reaching its potential. This is not a very good stealth game, and a very very bad Thief title, I\u0026rsquo;m saying this as a fan of stealth games in general, and not as a Thief fan, because despite all the criticism, I\u0026rsquo;ve never played a Thief game before.\nFirst-Hand Fan Verdict #This was my first Thief game, and I knew this was not a good one, though I decided to play it to see for myself. And all people say is true, this is a very bad stealth title, as already said, and it made me want to play the other Thief games, though not because this one is good, but because I keep hearing good things about them so I got very curious. I recommend this one is skipped and that people interested in the series buy and play the re-releases for the modern platforms, and stay away from this one.\n","date":"27 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/thief/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a bold attempt to revive the beloved stealth franchise for a modern audience.","title":"Thief"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 23 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nModernized Half-Life Rebirth #This title is an extraordinary reimagining of Valve’s 1998 classic Half-Life, brought to life by the dedicated team at Crowbar Collective. What began as a fan project evolved over many years into a full-fledged commercial release that both honors and enhances the original experience. Rebuilt in the Source engine, Black Mesa transforms the familiar environments of the Black Mesa Research Facility into richly detailed, immersive spaces that feel alive and modern without losing the tense, claustrophobic atmosphere that defined the original. Lighting, textures, and sound design have all been dramatically improved, giving the game a sense of realism and scale that Half-Life could only hint at two decades ago.\nRefined Combat Brilliance #Combat feels sharper and more deliberate, thanks to refined weapon handling, smarter enemy placement, and an improved sense of pacing. Classic moments, like the tram ride intro or the frantic struggle to reach the surface, retain their iconic punch, while the new dialogue and expanded NPC interactions add personality and depth to the world. The reimagined Xen chapters, once considered Half-Life’s weakest link, are now one of Black Mesa’s crowning achievements. Vast, colorful alien landscapes, intricate level design, and atmospheric music turn this final act into a stunning showcase of creativity and technical polish.\nPersonal Modding Memories #I have a long story with this game, back when I first heard about this, I hacked my way through the Steam Tools menus in order to enable the necessary SDK to be able to install this. This was due to this game not really being a game at the beginning of it\u0026rsquo;s conception, as already said, this was supposed to be a mod for Half-Life 2, so there was no Steam Store page, you just had to make it work like a mod. Despite all this, it was already a blast when I first played the unfinished version, and later I decided to replay this when I knew the Xen level was already finished.\nDefinitive Remake Achievement #It was so frustrating having a \u0026ldquo;to be continued\u0026rdquo; screen once you reached this part of the game back in the day, but I can safely say that it was worth the wait. Despite minor issues like occasional AI oddities or uneven difficulty spikes, this game stands as both a love letter to the original Half-Life and a testament to what passionate fans can achieve. It’s not just a remake, it’s the definitive way to relive one of the most influential shooters ever made.

The Glyph system is the game’s standout feature, letting you equip and combine magical abilities for both melee and ranged attacks, giving battles a strong strategic element.\nGothic Visual Mastery #Visually, the game is striking for the DS, with beautifully detailed environments, expressive sprites, and a dark, gothic tone that perfectly fits Castlevania’s identity. The soundtrack is equally memorable, mixing haunting melodies and energetic battle themes that enhance the atmosphere, it retains the same level of quality if previous entries in the franchise. Unlike some of its predecessors, Order of Ecclesia uses a mission-based structure rather than a single sprawling castle, which gives it a more focused pace while still offering secrets and backtracking opportunities.\nRewarding High Difficulty #However, this focus on precision and combat comes with a price, a high difficulty level. Boss fights are punishing, enemies hit hard, and the game demands mastery of its mechanics to progress. While this makes victory satisfying, it may also frustrate people expecting a more forgiving experience.

Instead of playing as a trained special agent, you took on the roles of everyday citizens trapped in the chaos of Raccoon City. Each character had unique abilities and items, encouraging teamwork and strategic cooperation across several self-contained scenarios. The game retained the familiar elements of the series, fixed camera angles, limited inventory space, scarce resources, and deliberate tank controls, but reimagined them for a cooperative experience.\nTeamwork Under Pressure #When played online, communication and coordination were essential, as the group had to solve puzzles, share items, and fight to stay alive amid the spreading T-virus. Offline, AI companions filled in for human players, though their sluggish responsiveness often frustrated solo players. If you are interested in the online experience, at least up until the moment I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, the community still seems to be active and have developed a way to bring back the online multiplayer feature.\nAmbitious Yet Limited #There are community servers which you can connect to and play the emulated version of the game after you go through some hacking to set things up properly. Technically, Outbreak was ambitious but hampered by the limitations of early 2000s online infrastructure. Slow load times, clunky menus, and limited communication options (restricted to preset phrases) made teamwork cumbersome. Yet despite its flaws, the game exuded atmosphere, with detailed environments, tense pacing, and a grim tone that captured the panic and hopelessness of Raccoon City better than many entries in the series.\nCult Classic Legacy #While not a mainstream hit at release, this gmae has since gained a devoted cult following. Fans continue to appreciate its creativity, sense of community, and survival horror authenticity, elements that laid the groundwork for future multiplayer experiments in the Resident Evil franchise. This was one of my favorite games of the PlayStation 2 simply because of it\u0026rsquo;s unique experience, not because of the multiplayer, but because of the amount of different outcomes each level had to offer.

It’s an ambitious attempt to blend the classic spirit of Tomb Raider, exploration, puzzles, and mythological intrigue, with more modern visuals and fluid gameplay. The game opens with a dramatic sequence in Croft Manor, immediately setting a darker and more personal tone. From there, Lara travels across richly detailed locations like the Mediterranean Sea, Thailand, Mexico, and the Arctic, each offering large, interconnected levels filled with secrets.\nStunning Atmospheric Worlds #The environments are stunning for their time, dripping with atmosphere and a sense of scale that few adventure games in 2008 could match. The underwater sections, in particular, highlight the game’s technical achievements with realistic lighting and impressive physics. This was a natural evolution of the franchise that was being influenced by other modern titles of it\u0026rsquo;s era, despite it having big influence in them on a distant past. Gameplay focuses heavily on exploration and environmental puzzles, which often span entire areas and require sharp observation and creative problem-solving.\nExploration Over Combat #Lara’s movement feels agile and more realistic than ever before, with a free-form climbing system that gives you multiple ways to traverse obstacles. However, the controls can sometimes feel finicky, especially during precision jumps or when the camera misbehaves, a lingering issue from earlier games in the series. Combat takes a back seat to exploration. While dual pistols and acrobatics return, enemy encounters are brief and less dynamic than in Legend. Instead, Underworld emphasizes solitude and discovery, which gives the game a meditative tone reminiscent of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, which is a good thing in my opinion, and I enjoyed this style more than the combat-focused one of Legend.\nMythic Narrative Closure #Narratively, the game ties together the trilogy’s loose threads, exploring Lara’s complex relationship with her missing mother and her moral struggle against the villainous Natla. The story delves into Norse mythology, adding an epic scale that feels fitting for Lara’s final journey in this continuity. Despite some technical issues and occasional awkward controls, this Tomb Raider entry remains an atmospheric, challenging, and visually impressive experience.

But for people seeking momentum or clear goals, its beauty may feel trapped behind layers of tedium and trial.

Despite all this, this is a very valuable experience to go through if you like titles such as Zelda, even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of similarities, they achieve the same goal: making the player curious enough to explore on it\u0026rsquo;s own and find it\u0026rsquo;s secrets. I just advise a heavy dose of patience because you\u0026rsquo;ll lose some hairs playing this.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/below/","section":"Posts","summary":"A hauntingly atmospheric top-down adventure that drops you onto a mysterious island to explore its depths.","title":"Below"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 25 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nModernized Doom Collection #This title is a remastered and expanded collection that compiles Doom 3, its expansion Resurrection of Evil, a brand-new mini-campaign titled The Lost Mission, and the original Doom and Doom II in one package. Developed by id Software and published by Bethesda, it was designed to reintroduce Doom 3 to a new generation of players while modernizing some of its systems for contemporary hardware. The result is a technically smoother experience that still retains much of the claustrophobic tension and atmospheric horror that defined the 2004 release.\nVisual and Gameplay Updates #Visually, this version improves lighting, texture sharpness, and performance, with better compatibility for newer PCs and even 3D display support. The inclusion of checkpoints, widescreen support, and native gamepad controls makes it more approachable and console-friendly. The infamous flashlight mechanic, once requiring people to switch between weapon and light, was revised so that the flashlight can now be used alongside weapons. This adjustment makes the gameplay flow more naturally but also changes the tone, reducing the feeling of vulnerability that gave the original such a unique sense of dread.\nContent Additions and Tradeoffs #From a content perspective, the package offers a lot of value. The Lost Mission provides several new levels, and the addition of the classic Doom titles creates a compact timeline of the franchise’s evolution. For newcomers, it’s an excellent way to explore Doom’s legacy from its early pixelated roots to its mid-2000s experiment with survival horror. For returning fans, however, the changes might feel mixed. The flashlight tweak, softer lighting, and more generous ammo placement make the experience easier and less suspenseful. The PC version also removes some of the original’s mod and multiplayer features, which disappointed parts of the community.\nPolished Yet Dated Experience #While this version isn’t a radical overhaul, it does provide a polished and stable version of original version that runs flawlessly on modern systems. The atmosphere, monster designs, and sound effects still create a thick, eerie tension that few shooters replicate today. Yet, by the standards at the time, the linear level design and repetitive enemy encounters were already showing their age. Overall, this game is a worthwhile purchase for those who want a convenient, optimized way to experience Doom 3 and its companions. It stands as a solid, if somewhat softened, reminder of id Software’s attempt to blend action and horror within the Doom universe.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/doom-3-bfg-edition/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a remastered and expanded collection that compiles all Doom 3 extra contents.","title":"Doom 3 BFG Edition"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 40 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRevolutionary 16-Bit Epic #This title is widely regarded as one of the crowning achievements of the 16-bit era and a landmark in the history of RPGs. It pushed the SNES hardware to its limits, delivering a world that felt vast, alive, and emotionally resonant. Unlike many RPGs of its time, this one does not center on a single protagonist, instead, it presents a sprawling ensemble cast, each character with a distinct personality, backstory, and role in the story. This approach allows the game to explore complex themes such as loss, oppression, redemption, and the cost of ambition, creating a narrative depth rarely seen in games of the era.\nRich World and Villains #The world of this title blends classic fantasy with steampunk aesthetics, filled with airships, industrial landscapes, and magical relics that hint at a lost past. You experience a journey across diverse environments, from bustling cities to desolate wastelands, encountering a variety of factions, each with its own motivations and struggles. The villains, particularly the enigmatic Kefka, are crafted with theatrical flair, making him one of the most memorable antagonists in gaming history due to his chaotic nature and descent into godlike madness.\nRefined Combat Systems #As for the gameplay, it refines the Active Time Battle system introduced in previous entries, providing fluid, strategic combat while giving you the freedom to develop their party through Espers and magicite. These systems allow for extensive customization of abilities and magic, ensuring that each playthrough can feel unique. Outside combat, exploration and interaction are richly rewarding, with hidden treasures, side quests, and secrets that encourage players to fully immerse themselves in the world. one of the best side-quests is the Legendary Dragon ones, I highly recommend not skipping this, they are a series of very difficulty and unique boss battles, which are a tradition of the FF franchise.\nIconic Visuals and Music #Visually, the game makes remarkable use of the SNES capabilities. Sprites are expressive, environments are detailed, and even minor animations convey personality and emotion. The soundtrack is nothing short of legendary, ranging from tender and melancholic melodies to epic orchestral pieces, each track perfectly complementing the narrative moments. Everything that has the Nobuo Uematsu touch is going to be the best gaming music you can experience, hands down. Iconic compositions like “Terra’s Theme,” “Aria di Mezzo Carattere,” and “Dancing Mad” remain celebrated decades later for their emotional power and technical sophistication.\nEmotional Narrative Depth #Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, Final Fantasy VI’s enduring appeal lies in its emotional resonance. Its story doesn’t shy away from tragedy or the consequences of its characters’ choices, creating a sense of weight and significance in every action. The game’s structure allows you to experience a dramatic tonal shift midway, giving a sense of scale and progression that was revolutionary for its time. Even today, this game stands as a benchmark for narrative-driven RPGs.\nTimeless RPG Masterpiece #Its combination of deep characterization, compelling storytelling, inventive gameplay mechanics, and unforgettable music ensures its place not only in the history of the Final Fantasy series but also in the broader history of video games. It remains a timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire developers, captivate players, and demonstrate the emotional and artistic potential of the medium. This is one of the best games of all time, I can\u0026rsquo;t decide if this is my favorite of the series, or FFVII (I have more nostalgic feelings towards this one), and it is undoubtedly a must-play if you like RPGs any extent, take advantage of the modern re-releases an don\u0026rsquo;t think twice. If you need a little push, I advise watching the Angry Video-Game Nerd video on this, that was what made me decide finally play this.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/final-fantasy-vi/","section":"Posts","summary":"A widely regarded as one of the crowning achievements of the 16-bit era and a landmark in the history of RPGs.","title":"Final Fantasy VI"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nAtmospheric Dystopian Journey #This title is a dark, atmospheric puzzle-platformer developed by same studio behind the acclaimed Limbo.

The game is presented in a 2.5D side-scrolling perspective, with meticulously crafted visuals and lighting that convey mood, tension, and storytelling without a single line of dialogue. Every detail, from the flickering lights to the distant sounds of unseen dangers, contributes to an immersive, haunting experience.\nSubtle Puzzles, Deep Story #The puzzles are subtle yet clever, often requiring you to manipulate objects, avoid detection, or use physics in unexpected ways. The game gradually escalates the sense of danger, introducing new mechanics and threats that keep the you constantly alert. Unlike many games, it communicates its story entirely through its environment, animations, and occasional surreal sequences, leaving much open to interpretation. This minimalist approach makes each discovery feel impactful and emotionally resonant.\nHaunting Artistic Mastery #A lot of people have praised it for its remarkable art direction, tightly designed gameplay, and emotional depth. Its combination of suspense, subtle horror, and moments of quiet introspection has been described as both haunting and thought-provoking. Many have highlighted how the game expands on the themes of its predecessor Limbo, offering a richer narrative and more nuanced atmosphere.

The game tells the story of a boy and his quirky companions, a giraffe with a helicopter tongue and a pet rock, as they embark on a bizarre quest to stop an evil villain from turning people, including the protagonist’s father, into hot dogs. From the very beginning, it’s clear that the game doesn’t take itself qtoo seriously. Its hand-drawn art style, full of bright colors and cartoonish charm, sets the stage for a world that feels both ridiculous and irresistibly fun.\nFun, Accessible Gameplay #The gameplay blends simple combat, platforming, and light RPG elements. You’ll slash enemies, jump across floating islands, and collect cupcakes and stickers as you progress through a series of small, story-driven worlds. The controls are tight and responsive. It’s approachable and friendly to people of all ages, offering a steady balance of action and humor that’s easy to pick up but hard to dislike.\nCharming Yet Simple #However, the game’s simplicity is also its biggest drawback. While its core mechanics are solid, they don’t evolve much over time, and some people may find the level design repetitive after a few hours. Combat, though fast-paced and flashy, can feel shallow compared to more complex platformers, and the story’s pacing sometimes slows down with fetch quests or reused environments. Still, the sheer charm of its characters and world keeps things engaging, helped along by a silly, heartfelt script that never fails to raise a smile. Overall, this game is a joyful, imaginative adventure that captures the spirit of childhood play.\nLighthearted Joyful Experience #It might not challenge seasoned platforming veterans, but its warmth, humor, and creativity make it an endearing experience for anyone looking for a light, feel-good game. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that make you laugh. Particularly I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity is a bad thing, not all needs to have over-the-top mechanics and features to be enjoyable, Nintendo titles are big examples of this. And as I do on all recommendations, when it comes to simpler games like this one, I highly recommend this is a 100% run, since it is so short and simple that it deserves to be played to the fullest in order to experience it properly.\n","date":"23 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-adventure-pals/","section":"Posts","summary":"A delightfully strange and heartwarming action-platformer that thrives on its sense of humor and creativity.","title":"The Adventure Pals"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBold 3D Reimagining #This title is a bold and innovative reimagining of the series. Rather than sticking to the traditional top-down grid-based gameplay of its predecessors, the game ventures into fully 3D environments, a significant shift that transforms how puzzles, combat, and exploration work. The story mode places Bomberman on a quest to stop the evil Altair and his minions, featuring multiple themed worlds filled with intricate puzzles, secrets, and platforming challenges.\nNew Mechanics and Depth #The transition to 3D allows for new gameplay mechanics, like the ability to pick up and throw bombs, stack them, or use their explosions to launch Bomberman into the air, an essential skill for reaching hidden areas and solving environmental puzzles. This design encourages experimentation and rewards careful timing and spatial awareness. Each stage is packed with collectible items and hidden gold cards that unlock extra content, adding depth and replay value.\nTactical 3D Multiplayer #The multiplayer mode, while slower and less frantic than the classic SNES versions, introduces spherical arenas and vertical layouts that make matches feel more tactical. You must think in three dimensions, planning bomb placements and escape routes with greater precision. It was quite a blast back in the day since very few people managed to master the 3D mechanics of the transition, when compared to the classics, especially when it comes to the fast-paced multiplayer matches.\nColorful N64 Adventure #Visually, it captures the colorful charm of the series, with expressive characters, varied environments, and a distinctive polygonal style that defines late-’90s Nintendo 64 aesthetics. The OST is upbeat and atmospheric, matching each world’s tone perfectly. Though some fans missed the fast-paced simplicity of earlier entries, this game stands out as one of the franchise’s most creative and ambitious installments. It successfully blends puzzle-solving, exploration, and classic combat into a cohesive 3D adventure that remains both nostalgic and genuinely engaging.\n","date":"22 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bomberman-64/","section":"Posts","summary":"A bold and innovative reimagining of the series, venturing this classic franchise into fully 3D environments.","title":"Bomberman 64"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDaring 3D Reinvention #This title took a daring step away from the franchise’s tried-and-true multiplayer formula, venturing into full 3D single-player platforming territory. It transforms Bomberman’s familiar bomb-based gameplay into a more expansive adventure — one that feels closer to Super Mario 64 or Crash Bandicoot than the grid-based arenas fans were used to. And despite me being a fan of the original formula, I also forever thought about playing a more traditional Bomberman, such as this one, and despite it\u0026rsquo;s flaws, I loved the the style.\nAmbitious Planet-Spanning Story #The story is surprisingly ambitious for a Bomberman game. You play as the heroic Bomberman, who sets off across several planets to rescue Princess Millian and recover a stolen data disk containing critical information. This intergalactic journey takes you through a variety of colorful worlds, from snowy landscapes and lava-filled caverns to futuristic bases, each packed with enemies, hazards, and secrets to uncover.\nPlatforming and Gadgets #Gameplay revolves around precise platforming, bomb-throwing combat, and light puzzle-solving. You gains access to new moves and gadgets, like a jetpack and underwater gear, which keep the action varied and lively. Though you can only access these gadgets during some predetermined sections of the game, specifically, you play through some levels using them, from start to finish. The controls are responsive, though the fixed camera can occasionally make platforming tricky.\nSingle-Player Focused Design #Unlike most Bomberman titles, this one completely omits the trademark multiplayer mode, which disappointed some fans but allowed the developers to focus on crafting a cohesive, story-driven experience. Particularly I never minded it not having a MP mode, I highly value a polished single-player campaign over one. One of the standout aspects of this is its OST. The energetic blend of electronic, drum ‘n’ bass, and ambient tracks perfectly complements the game’s fast-paced, futuristic vibe.\nUnderrated N64 Experiment #While the game can feel repetitive in its level structure and lacks the depth of other 3D platformers of its era, its charm, music, and smooth gameplay give it a distinct identity within the series. This game may not be the definitive Bomberman experience, but it’s an underrated gem, a creative and confident experiment that still stands out in the N64 library for its unique mix of action and style. I highly recommend not skipping this one if you are a like of 3D platformers to any extent, despite it\u0026rsquo;s short length and levels, it is still a very enjoyable experience.\n","date":"22 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bomberman-hero/","section":"Posts","summary":"A step away from the franchise\u0026rsquo;s multiplayer formula, venturing into full 3D single-player platforming territory.","title":"Bomberman Hero"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 50 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Masterpiece of Art #This title is one of those rare games that manages to be both a thrilling action experience and a profound work of art. Developed under the eccentric and visionary direction of Yoko Taro, it combines stylish, high-speed combat with a layered narrative that explores what it means to be human, through the eyes of androids and machines long after humanity has vanished. I knew this was one of the highly praised titles of all time, but I thought this was because of how exotic it was, not to mention it was part of a franchise which I had never heard of. But after playing this and experiencing almost all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents, I can safely say this is absolutely one of the best games of all time.\nA Story Beyond War #Set thousands of years in the future, the story follows combat androids 2B, 9S, and later A2, as they fight to reclaim Earth from alien-created machines. What begins as a seemingly straightforward war between androids and robots slowly unravels into a philosophical and emotional journey filled with existential questions, moral ambiguity, and heartbreak. And for me this is where this game shines, I think it\u0026rsquo;s biggest strength is it\u0026rsquo;s story and the meaning behind it. And I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about some cliche vangeance plot, or some convoluted story with a lot of plot-twists, this is genuinely one of the best stories you can find on modern videogames.\nRoutes, Endings, Gameplay #Each of the game’s multiple main routes (A through E) reveals new perspectives and hidden truths, turning the act of replaying into a vital part of the storytelling rather than simple repetition. The game also has a ton of secret endings, which are mostly meme endings, you\u0026rsquo;ll for sure experience some of them without even knowing. The combat is fast, fluid, and satisfying, allowing you to chain together sword slashes, ranged attacks, and acrobatics with ease. It also constantly experiments with gameplay perspective, shifting from 3D hack-and-slash to 2D platforming or even top-down bullet-hell segments, often within the same mission.\nWorld and Atmosphere #These transitions feel seamless and serve both mechanical and narrative purposes, keeping you constantly engaged. Visually, the game embraces a desolate beauty, ruined cities overrun by nature, hauntingly empty deserts, and broken amusement parks filled with lifeless machines that somehow evoke emotion. The minimalist art direction is elevated by an extraordinary OST, whose music shifts between ethereal vocals and driving battle themes, perfectly capturing the game’s emotional tone.\nEmotional, Philosophical Impact #Where this game truly stands out is in its willingness to challenge you emotionally and intellectually. It questions purpose, consciousness, and the nature of life itself, all through the lens of characters who are, ironically, not human. The final hours, and especially the ending sequence, are among the most memorable and impactful in gaming history. This game is a rare masterpiece that transcends genres. It’s not just a game you play, it’s one you feel, think about, and remember long after the credits roll. This is absolutely a must-play if you like action games, or if you agree with the idea that videogames are a work of art, to any degree.\n","date":"22 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/nier-automata/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is one of those rare games that manages to be both a thrilling action experience and a profound work of art.","title":"NieR Automata"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nRefined 16-Bit Sequel #This title is a standout sequel that refined nearly every aspect of the original, cementing Bomberman’s reputation as one of the most iconic multiplayer experiences of the 16-bit era. The game continues the series’ signature formula of maze-based action, where you strategically place bombs to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies, and outsmart opponents.\nCharming Story Structure #The story mode, while simple, adds charm and structure to the explosive fun. You are captured by the sinister “Five Dastardly Bombers,” a group of villains who each rule their own themed stage. Each level introduces unique environmental hazards and enemy patterns, keeping the gameplay varied. The boss battles, against the Dastardly Bombers themselves, stand out for their creativity, requiring both quick reflexes and smart bomb placement.\nIconic Multiplayer Chaos #Where it truly shines, though, is in its multiplayer mode. Supporting up to four players with the SNES Multitap, it’s an absolute blast of chaotic strategy and quick thinking. Every match feels different, with the simple mechanics allowing for deep tactical play, trapping friends, predicting movements, and making split-second escapes. The balance between luck, skill, and chaos makes it endlessly replayable, and it’s still one of the most beloved party games of its time.\nColorful SNES Presentation #Visually, the game is bright and colorful, with clean sprites and expressive animations that give personality to both Bomberman and his foes. The OST is equally memorable similar to other entries in the series, full of energetic tunes that perfectly match the game’s fast-paced tension.\nPolished Timeless Formula #Though it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, this game refines it to near perfection. It’s a textbook example of how to make a sequel, polishing what worked, adding subtle improvements, and delivering an experience that’s both accessible and deeply satisfying. Even decades later, it remains a timeless gem and a must-play for anyone exploring the SNES library.\n","date":"22 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-bomberman-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a standout sequel that refined nearly every aspect of the original release.","title":"Super Bomberman 2"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRefined Party-Action Formula #This title is a vibrant and finely tuned installment in Hudson Soft’s long-running party-action franchise.

The result is a title that perfectly captures the spirit of the series, simple yet strategic, chaotic yet endlessly fun.\nCharabom-Enhanced Adventure #The single-player mode continues the familiar structure, you progress through themed worlds filled with traps, enemies, and clever stage mechanics before facing off against imaginative bosses. Each stage feels carefully designed, encouraging both quick thinking and tactical bomb placement. The introduction of the Charabom system, which allows you to ride animal-like companions that grant special abilities, adds variety and depth, offering new ways to approach puzzles and combat alike.\nTimeless Multiplayer Chaos #And you are even able to bring them into bossfights, making these encounters much easier overall. Where it truly shines, however, is in its multiplayer mode. Up to four players can battle across a wide selection of colorful, hazard-filled arenas that keep every match unpredictable.

This was the Bomberman in which I played the most out of the multiplayer, but mostly because it was my first Bomberman ever.\nPolished SNES Classic #Although it doesn’t revolutionize the series, this game refines nearly every aspect of the formula, delivering one of the most polished and enjoyable Bomberman experiences on the Super Nintendo. It’s a charming, fast-paced classic that embodies the golden age of local multiplayer gaming.

Rather than offering a direct sequel, it explores parallel worlds, fate, and identity through an entirely new cast in which the MC is called Serge, a young boy who finds himself at the center of a cosmic mystery after discovering a world where he apparently died years ago. This premise quickly expands into a deeply layered story that blends science fiction, fantasy, and philosophical reflection on the consequences of human choices.\nVivid Worlds and Music #The game’s world is stunningly realized for its time, boasting vibrant pre-rendered backgrounds and expressive character designs that give each location, from tropical islands to eerie ruins, a distinct personality. The OST is often hailed as one of the finest in video game history, weaving Celtic, tropical, and melancholy melodies into a soundscape that perfectly complements the game’s dreamlike tone.\nUnique Combat and Cast #Gameplay-wise, it departs from standard JRPG conventions. Its stamina-based combat system encourages fluid strategy, rewarding rhythm and balance rather than raw grinding. The vast roster of over 40 recruitable characters may overwhelm some people, but it showcases an impressive range of personalities and playstyles. You don\u0026rsquo;t really need to interact with all of them, but I highly recommend doing so, their side-quests are what makes this game shine.

The game successfully adapts the spirit of the PlayStation classics into the GBA’s limited hardware, delivering tight controls, colorful visuals, and inventive level design. The story picks up after the first GBA title, with the villain N. Tropy teaming up with a new foe, N. Trance, to brainwash Crash’s friends.\nFaithful Crash Gameplay #While the plot is light and mostly serves as a backdrop for the action, it adds a fun sense of continuity and personality. The gameplay remains faithful to the series’ roots: precise jumps, crate-smashing, and collecting crystals and gems across themed worlds. The mix of forward-scrolling 3D-style levels and classic side-scrolling stages keeps things fresh, and the addition of special stages, like jetpack or surfboard segments, adds variety and challenge.\nBalanced Challenge \u0026amp; Polish #SImilar to other GBA Crash, this feels like playing the side-scrolling levels of the regular PlayStation 3D Crash, and with occasional alternative levels.

Using a modified version of the Doom engine, the game trades science fiction for grim medieval fantasy, plunging players into a cursed world filled with twisted architecture, sinister catacombs, and demonic sorcerers.\nCorvus and Mystic Arsenal #The MC is called Corvus, an elven hero rebelling against the evil Serpent Riders who have corrupted the realm. The game’s arsenal replaces shotguns and rockets with mystical weapons, like the ethereal crossbow, the Hellstaff, and the Phoenix Rod, each with satisfying impact and variety. Power-ups like the Tome of Power amplify your attacks in spectacular ways, and items such as wings of wrath or morph ovum add a touch of playful experimentation to the brutal action.\nInnovative Early Mechanics #What really sets Heretic apart is its depth for its time. It introduced an inventory system, allowing you to strategically manage consumable items, and featured vertical aiming, something rare in early shooters. And despite this mechanic being a very common thing today, this was revolutionary at the time. The levels are cleverly designed, filled with secrets, traps, and atmospheric lighting that enhance the sense of dread and discovery.

You control a mysterious robed traveler in a vast, sun-swept desert, on a pilgrimage toward a distant, glowing mountain. The game’s narrative is entirely wordless, there’s no dialogue, no text, just the environments, the music, and subtle interactions to tell the story. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t really knew how to interpret this game since everybody was telling me this is a very personal game, and to sum it up, in my opinion, this game is one that you feel it instead of understanding it.\nBeauty Through Simplicity #What sets this one apart is its ability to create emotional resonance through simplicity. The sweeping landscapes, from shifting dunes to ancient ruins, are visually stunning, and every area feels carefully crafted to convey a sense of awe and wonder. The musical score, dynamically changing with your actions, heightens every moment, making the world feel alive and responsive. It has some occasional lightweight puzzles here and there just to make things interesting, not to mention some unique and exotic platforming sections.\nUnique Wordless Multiplayer #A, by far, the most unique aspect of the game is its multiplayer component.

Set during the aftermath of Julius Caesar\u0026rsquo;s assassination, you alternate between two MCs, Agrippa, a gladiator trying to clear his father’s name, and Octavianus, who uses stealth to uncover the conspiracy behind the political turmoil. This dual gameplay offers a unique perspective on Roman history, blending visceral combat with investigative exploration.\nCombat vs. Stealth #Agrippa’s segments are the highlight, featuring brutal melee combat where weapon variety, durability, and crowd reactions add depth. The game rewards stylish and crowd-pleasing moves, enhancing the gladiatorial atmosphere. In contrast, Octavianus’s stealth sections focus on sneaking through Roman streets and solving environmental puzzles, though these parts can feel slower and less refined compared to the action-heavy sequences.\nStrong Pacing and Style #I consider the pacing of this game to be one of the best that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, due to the balanced frequency that you alternate between characters. The story is engaging and presented through cinematic cutscenes, offering a fresh take on historical events. The visual design mixes realistic environments with stylized characters, creating a distinct, though sometimes inconsistent, aesthetic. Voice acting and translation occasionally feel awkward, but the narrative remains compelling enough to carry you through both the combat and stealth portions of the game.\nA Distinctive PS2 Gem #Overall, this game received generally favorable reviews for its inventive blend of gameplay styles and its depiction of ancient Rome. While the stealth missions are less polished, the gripping combat, creative mechanics, and intriguing story make it a memorable and distinctive PS2 title. I consider this one of the best titles of it\u0026rsquo;s platform because of my nostalgic feeling towards it, but after I replayed it not too long ago, I realized it is indeed a very good title.

Serving as a direct sequel to Super Metroid, MC is yet again Samus after she becomes infected by the mysterious X Parasite, forcing her to rely on a new, biologically altered Power Suit. The result is a more vulnerable version of the iconic bounty hunter, which adds a fresh layer of tension to the gameplay.\nLinear but Purposeful #The game’s structure is notably more linear than its predecessors, guiding you through specific objectives across the labyrinthine corridors of the Biologic Space Laboratories station. While this design sacrifices some of the freeform exploration that defined earlier Metroid games, it replaces it with a stronger sense of narrative momentum and purpose. Despite it being more linear when compared to other entries in the series, it is as satisfying as any other, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get myself turned down by this in any way.\nAtmospheric Sector Exploration #Each sector feels distinct, with cleverly designed layouts that reward backtracking and curiosity once new abilities are unlocked. What truly elevates the game is its mood, the sterile, almost claustrophobic setting and unsettling soundtrack create a palpable sense of dread. Especially when the SA-X, a terrifying clone of Samus, stalks the you through the station. These encounters are rare but unforgettable, turning moments of exploration into heart-pounding survival.\nFocused Cinematic Masterpiece #With tight controls, beautiful pixel art, and a cinematic story that adds emotional depth to Samus as a character, this game stands as both a technical showcase for the GBA and a bold narrative step for the series. It may be more guided than Super Metroid, but it delivers an equally memorable, more focused experience that still holds up remarkably well today. This is definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, or if you like this formula to any extent.\n","date":"20 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metroid-fusion/","section":"Posts","summary":"A fast-paced, atmospheric reinvention of the Metroid formula that merges action, exploration, and narrative tension.","title":"Metroid Fusion"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHorror Asylum Mystery #This title is a first-person survival horror game that quickly became a modern benchmark for the genre.

Armed with nothing but a camcorder, Miles must navigate blood-soaked corridors, avoid deranged inmates, and uncover the horrific truth lurking within the facility.\nVulnerable Survival Tension #The game’s most distinctive feature is its commitment to vulnerability, there are no weapons, no combat, and no way to fight back. Instead, survival depends on running, hiding, and conserving battery power for the camcorder’s night vision, which adds a chilling green tint to every shadowy encounter. The sound design amplifies the terror, with distant screams, echoing footsteps, and heavy breathing pulling players deeper into the asylum’s suffocating atmosphere.\nRelentless Atmospheric Terror #Visually, this game delivers claustrophobic environments dripping with decay and dread, enhanced by realistic lighting that makes every flickering bulb a source of anxiety. While some of its scares rely heavily on repetition and jump shocks, the sheer intensity of its pacing and the oppressive tone sustain the fear throughout.

The game’s highlight is its sniping system, bullet drop, wind resistance, and breath control all factor into each shot, creating a rewarding and tense experience. The X-Ray Kill Cam, showing bullets tearing through enemy bodies in slow motion, adds a unique cinematic flair that became the series’ signature.\nAging Design Issues #However, the game shows its age in several areas, levels are mostly linear, limiting your freedom, and the AI can feel inconsistent, sometimes spotting you unrealistically or failing to react at all. Stealth sections outside of sniping scenarios tend to be clunky, and the visuals, while atmospheric, are dated compared to other 2012 releases. Though I still recommend going stealth on this title since this is really how this game was planned to be played in the first place, not to mention it is more fun using this approach.\nStill Worth Playing #Despite its flaws, this game remains enjoyable for those who appreciate patience and precision over fast-paced action. It’s a solid niche experience, not a technical masterpiece, but a satisfying sniping simulator that rewards methodical play. This was the first title of many when it comes to this franchise, despite it having released titles previous to this one.

The HD visuals breathe new life into its distinctive cel-shaded art style, making the ocean and islands more vibrant and expressive than ever before. I highly recommend playing this version instead of the original one, and this is a rare things for me to say, I tend to stick to the originals, but this remaster is simply too good not to play, in every single way.\nTimeless World \u0026amp; Upgrades #The game’s world feels timeless, filled with charm, personality, and a sense of adventure that few others in the series match. The story remains heartfelt and whimsical, supported by memorable characters and a beautifully composed OST that enhances every voyage across the Great Sea. This version improves on the original with smoother performance and several QOL upgrades, such as the Swift Sail for faster travel, streamlined inventory management, and enhanced use of the Wii U GamePad for maps and item control.\nRefined Yet Imperfect #These changes make exploration far more enjoyable and reduce some of the pacing issues of the 2003 release. However, a few elements still show their age, certain quests, especially toward the end, can feel repetitive or slow, and the sailing, while atmospheric, may test the patience of people seeking constant action. Despite these small flaws, this game remains one of the most charming and emotionally resonant adventures in the Zelda series. It’s both a faithful homage to the original and the best way to experience its magic today.\nEssential Zelda Adventure #This is a must-play if you like this franchise to any extent, it\u0026rsquo;s sense of adventure is the same as any other entry in the series, some people may get themselves fooled by the nature of the sailing mechanic, thinking if would limit the exploration and world-building, but it is quite the opposite, it is a very welcome addition to the varied mechanics the Zelda developers tend to be inclined to implement.

From the opening moments, the game bursts with personality, lush jungles, crumbling temples, and explosive minecart rides create a world that feels alive and demanding in equal measure. The 3D visuals add surprising depth to each environment, making the layered backgrounds and foregrounds more dynamic and visually engaging than ever before on a portable console.\nImproved Button Controls #One of the biggest improvements over the Wii version is the control scheme, the 3DS release removes the motion controls entirely, opting for traditional button inputs instead, and this is a very big deal if you, like me, are not a fan of motion controls. This change immediately makes the gameplay feel tighter and more responsive, especially in a title that relies so heavily on precision platforming. You can now roll, ground pound, and blow through obstacles with satisfying accuracy, which enhances the flow of each level.\nChallenging Yet Accessible #The game’s difficulty remains challenging, but it’s now easier to focus on timing and execution rather than fighting the controls. To make the experience more welcoming for newcomers, it introduces a “New Mode,” which grants Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong extra hearts and provides access to helpful items sold by Cranky Kong. This mode softens some of the game’s notorious difficulty spikes while keeping the core platforming intact for veterans who prefer a real test of skill. Particularly I never played using this mode, but I thought about using it sometimes because even though I consider myself a veteran when it comes to platforming games, I still struggled to beat and 100% this title.\nNew Levels, Trade-offs #Additionally, this version features eight brand-new levels in the “Cloud Gateway” world, offering clever twists and inventive platforming sections that further extend the game’s longevity. There are, however, a few trade-offs. The game’s frame rate is capped at around 30 FPS, which makes animations a bit less fluid and can occasionally affect precision during fast-paced sequences. The smaller 3DS screen also means that certain background elements or hazards can blend together, especially in busier levels, making it harder to judge distances. Still, these are minor issues in an otherwise polished and ambitious handheld port.\nA Must-Play Platformer #Overall, this game stands as one of the finest platformers available on the 3DS. It combines Retro Studios’ signature craftsmanship with the portability and accessibility of Nintendo’s beloved handheld. Its satisfying difficulty curve, tight controls, and rich presentation make it a joy to revisit. Despite a few technical compromises, the game’s spirit remains intact, offering a thrilling, challenging, and deeply rewarding journey through Donkey Kong’s world. This is mos definitely a must-play if you like platformers to any extent, or the DK franchise in general.\n","date":"16 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/donkey-kong-country-returns/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a remarkable handheld adaptation of the Wii classic, skillfully reimagined for the Nintendo 3DS.","title":"Donkey Kong Country Returns"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation Portable ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nEpic PSP Prequel #This title is one of the most technically impressive and narratively engaging titles ever released for the PlayStation Portable.

The story follows him on a journey to save the world from eternal darkness after the sun mysteriously vanishes, leading him through mythological realms filled with danger, betrayal, and emotional turmoil.\nStunning Handheld Presentation #For a handheld game, it delivers a remarkable presentation, the visuals push the PSP to its limits, featuring richly detailed environments, cinematic camera angles, and fluid animations that rival its PlayStation 2 predecessors. This was one of the most demanding titles for the platform, especially when it comes to the balancing between performance and battery life. The combat system remains faithful to the series’ core, fast-paced, visceral, and deeply satisfying.\nFaithful, Impactful Combat #Magic abilities and brutal finishing moves add variety, while the game’s boss fights stand out as both challenging and spectacular, so more of the same and if you already liked the previous titles, there is no excuse not to like this one too. What truly sets the game apart is how well it captures the tone and emotional depth of the mainline entries. Despite its shorter runtime, it balances large-scale action with moments of vulnerability, especially in Kratos’s interactions with his daughter, Calliope.\nPortable Cinematic Epic #The orchestral soundtrack and powerful voice acting further enhance the cinematic experience, making it easy to forget you’re playing on a handheld device. In the end, this game stands as a masterclass in adapting console-quality gameplay and storytelling to portable form.

The MC is called Ico, a young boy born with horns, who is abandoned in a sprawling, foreboding castle. The game begins with Ico’s escape from confinement, but it quickly becomes clear that his journey is about more than just physical freedom. Along the way, he encounters Yorda, a mysterious girl trapped in the castle, and the gameplay revolves around guiding her safely through puzzles and dangerous environments.\nWordless Storytelling Design #The partnership between Ico and Yorda is central to the experience, creating a wordless narrative driven entirely by player interaction and environmental storytelling. It’s design is striking in its simplicity, there is almost no HUD, dialogue is sparse, and enemies are minimal, allowing you to focus entirely on exploration, puzzle-solving, and the growing emotional connection between the characters. The architecture of the castle, with its towering walls, narrow bridges, and vast empty halls, conveys a haunting sense of isolation, yet the presence of Yorda adds warmth and urgency to every step.\nAtmosphere and Teamwork #The puzzles often require teamwork, reinforcing the bond between Ico and Yorda while providing gentle but satisfying challenges. Visually, ICO is ethereal, with soft lighting, misty landscapes, and a muted color palette that enhances the sense of melancholy and wonder. The OST complements this atmosphere perfectly, with quiet, haunting melodies that evoke a sense of timelessness and introspection. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, this game achieves a profound emotional resonance, leaving you with a lingering sense of beauty and poignancy.\nA Timeless Classic #This is most definitely one of the best games of all time, and a must-play if you consider video-games to be art to any extent. Some may say this title shares it\u0026rsquo;s world with Shadow of the Colossus, not just because of the team behind the development, but also because of a lot of similarities that they share. This is what drove me to play this title in the first place since I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of SOTN and I there is very little content related to it\u0026rsquo;s universe as of now.

The fully 3D environments and free camera control felt like a natural modernization of the franchise, offering greater freedom and immersion compared to the earlier games’ cinematic but restrictive design.\nCharacters and Presentation #And while I admit I really liked the characters overall, in terms of personality and gameplay, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really any reason to go in-depth with any of them. You can simply choose the one you liked the most and focus on making that one stronger, particularly I really liked Akane since I enjoy playing with nimble characters in general.

However, Dawn of Dreams was not without flaws, the story, while expansive, suffered from uneven pacing and occasionally clunky dialogue that weakened its emotional impact.\nDifficulty and Repetition #Some people criticized the game for reusing enemies and assets from earlier titles, and the difficulty curve could be inconsistent, certain battles felt dragged out or overly punishing, while others were trivialized by abundant healing items. The previous titles had some spongy enemies and very long battles, but since this one introduced a lot of RPG mechanics, this escalated a lot, some fights are really tiring to go through, and some sections are unnecessarily difficult.\nUnderrated Yet Influential #Despite these issues, this game remains an underappreciated gem in Capcom’s library. It pushed the series toward deeper mechanics and richer gameplay, even if it sacrificed some of the dark atmosphere and tight storytelling that defined its predecessors.

The MC this time is called Flint, a young adventurer seeking revenge against the villainous pirate Mephisto, who becomes entangled in a larger plot involving a corrupt baron, enchanted keys, and a scheme to control the world through mechanical puppets.\nCombat and Exploration #Gameplay revolves around real-time sword combat, exploration, and intricate puzzle-solving. Many dungeons feature clever mechanisms and platforming challenges that recall the spirit of the original Alundra, though the 3D camera and somewhat stiff controls can make precision moments frustrating.

It is so hard that, in order to finish the game, I admit that I had to use cheat codes, otherwise it would be a nightmarish experience during the late-game stages. Its precise platforming, tricky enemy placement, and limited continues demand both patience and skill.\nRewarding Classic Platformer #However, that challenge adds to its lasting appeal, making each completed level feel genuinely rewarding. The game’s simple mechanics, jumping, punching, and later gliding, are used cleverly throughout, ensuring the gameplay stays fresh and inventive. As one of the most visually impressive and artistically ambitious titles of its time, this game remains a defining entry in the platformer genre. It established a beloved franchise and proved that even in the era of 3D gaming’s rise, 2D artistry and tight design could still deliver a magical and memorable experience.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/rayman/","section":"Posts","summary":"The first Rayman entry is a landmark 2D platformer that introduced players to Ubisoft’s now-iconic limbless hero.","title":"Rayman"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nFlexible Stealth Gameplay #This Splinter Cell entry is a polished and versatile stealth-action game that refines the series’ formula with a focus on player choice. It allows you to complete missions using different playstyles, sneaking through shadows as a ghost, silently eliminating enemies as a panther, or going loud with direct combat. Though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make any sense to play this if you are not going full stealth/assassin since this is the main idea of this game, though the \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; route is always available.\nFreedom and Atmosphere #This flexibility, paired with strong level design featuring multiple paths and tools, gives each mission a sense of freedom and replayability that few stealth games achieve. Unfortunately for me, I played this game very late, so I have no experience with it\u0026rsquo;s online features in order to be able to give any meaningful opinion on this. Its atmosphere captures the essence of espionage with clever use of lighting and sound, and the wide range of gadgets reinforces the tactical gameplay Splinter Cell is known for.\nStory and Presentation Issues #However, the story feels fairly conventional, and the change in Sam Fisher’s voice and tone may not satisfy long-time fans, and I particularly don\u0026rsquo;t mind this but I can see this being something that the community would bring up at the time of it\u0026rsquo;s release. While the visuals are serviceable, some textures and animations show their age, and the game occasionally leans too heavily toward action, diluting the stealth tension of earlier titles like Chaos Theory.\nStrong Modern Entry #Despite these flaws, this game stands as one of the most complete entries in the series. It balances modern accessibility with classic stealth depth, delivering an engaging and replayable experience for both newcomers and veterans of the franchise. I would only suggest this as a must-play for fans of the franchise, otherwise, it is just a very good stealth game in general, just not as legendary as it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors.\n","date":"15 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/splinter-cell-blacklist/","section":"Posts","summary":"A polished and versatile stealth-action game that refines the series\u0026rsquo; formula with a focus on player choice.","title":"Splinter Cell Blacklist"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nParallel Black Mesa Perspective #This title is the second official expansion for Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra. Originally intended as part of the Dreamcast port (which was ultimately canceled), the expansion was later released for PC. This time, the MC is called Barney Calhoun, one of the blue-uniformed security guards glimpsed in the original game. The story unfolds parallel to Gordon Freeman’s adventure, showing familiar events from a new angle. You start your day on a routine shift before everything goes wrong, and soon you’re fighting for survival through collapsing corridors, alien attacks, and government clean-up squads.\nRefined Familiar Gameplay #Gameplay-wise, Blue Shift doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it reuses most weapons, enemies, and mechanics from the base game. However, it refines the formula with strong level design and a smoother flow that emphasizes puzzle-solving and environmental storytelling over pure combat. The pacing feels tighter and more grounded, focusing on Barney’s more human-scale struggle rather than Freeman’s world-saving mission. I love this kind of approach to expansions, showing a different angle of the same events, ever since I first experienced it back on PlayStation 1 with the RE titles.\nShort but Satisfying #Its biggest drawback is its length, the entire campaign can be completed in around three to four hours, it ends just as you feel fully immersed, which can be disappointing. Still, what’s there is polished, well-paced, and narratively satisfying. This game is a compact but quality expansion that enriches the Half-Life universe. It doesn’t push boundaries or add new gameplay systems, but its strong design and fresh perspective make it a worthwhile return to Black Mesa for fans who want a more personal, contained story.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/half-life-blue-shift/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is the second official expansion for Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra.","title":"Half-Life Blue Shift"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nMythic Action RPG #This title is one of the most distinctive action RPGs of its time, blending historical settings, emotional storytelling, and inventive gameplay into a hauntingly beautiful adventure. It serves as the second entry in an informal trilogy alongside Soul Blazer and Terranigma, exploring themes of human evolution, civilization, and spiritual growth, so if you liked any of those titles, this is definitely a must-play alone by the fact that it happens in the same universe.\nWorld-Spanning Hero Journey #The MC is called Will, a young boy with psychic powers who sets out on a journey that takes him across the world, from the Nazca Plains and Angkor Wat to the Great Pyramid. The game reimagines real historical landmarks as mysterious dungeons filled with monsters and puzzles, blending myth and history into a surreal fantasy world. Will can transform into powerful warrior forms like Freedan and Shadow, each with unique abilities that keep combat and exploration fresh.\nBalanced Gameplay Design #The gameplay strikes a balance between action and puzzle-solving: clearing enemies rewards you with permanent stat boosts, and the lack of traditional experience points encourages exploration over grinding. This may sound limiting, but the other elements of the game are good enough to make up for it. Its tight level design, emotional dialogue, and understated storytelling create an atmosphere that feels more introspective than most RPGs of the era.\nEmotional Visual Atmosphere #Visually, it is rich in color and mood, with a soundtrack that heightens the game’s mysterious and sometimes melancholy tone. And while not having the same quality as most JRPGs at the time, this is still a good OST overall, just with a different tone in order to it fit with the main plot. Its story of loss, discovery, and sacrifice carries surprising emotional weight, especially as it builds toward a bittersweet ending. This is a game that captures both the wonder and tragedy of human history through the lens of an imaginative journey.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/illusion-of-gaia/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the most distinctive action RPGs of its time, blending historical settings and emotional storytelling.","title":"Illusion of Gaia"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 24 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nExpanded Dungeon Adventure #The second entry of the Legend of Grimrock franchise is a masterful revival of classic dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, blending old-school mechanics with modern design. Set on the mysterious Isle of Nex, the game expands beyond the confined corridors of its predecessor to include lush outdoor environments, from dense forests and swamps to ancient ruins and temples. This variety gives exploration a refreshing sense of scale and discovery, making every new area feel unique and dangerous.\nImproved Core Gameplay #The sense of adventure this title introduced is amazing when compared to the first entry, although I also really enjoyed the experience of the first game, I think this second entry is a much better game overall. The core gameplay revolves around grid-based movement, real-time combat, and intricate puzzles that demand both logic and observation. Many puzzles are deviously designed, rewarding careful attention and experimentation while occasionally leading into frustration due to their difficulty.\nRefined Combat Systems #Combat retains the tense, positional dance of the first game, where timing and maneuvering around enemies are key, though it can sometimes feel clunky due to the grid system. But if you enjoyed the firs title there is little to no surprises in the combat formula, besides new additions regarding skills, perks and spells. Character creation and progression are deeper this time around, offering more classes, races, and skills that allow for distinct party builds.\nAtmospheric Exploration Appeal #The game’s atmosphere is one of its greatest strengths, haunting soundscapes, clever lighting, and the constant threat of danger create a palpable sense of immersion. However, the non-linear structure can lead to moments of confusion, especially for newcomers, as the game offers little guidance on where to go or what to do next. As much as this is a complain of a lot of people, this is actually the opposite for me I enjoyed the semi-open-world elements of this game more than the linear-dungeon-based formula of the first entry.\nRewarding Old-School Experience #Overall, this game is a challenging, atmospheric, and deeply rewarding experience for people who appreciate exploration and problem-solving over hand-holding. It demands patience and persistence but pays off with a sense of accomplishment few modern RPGs can match. This is a must-play if you enjoyed the first title or if you like this kind of grid-based party-RPG style game to any extent, it is one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/legend-of-grimrock-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"A revival of classic dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master, blending old-school mechanics with modern design.","title":"Legend of Grimrock 2"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nStealth-Action Revolution #This title is a landmark in the stealth-action genre, widely regarded as one of the most influential games of its era. The MC is called Solid Snake, a legendary operative sent to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility and neutralize a rogue special forces unit threatening global security. Unlike traditional action games of the time, it emphasizes stealth and strategy, encouraging you to avoid direct confrontation, use distractions, and carefully plan their approach to each encounter.\nCinematic Narrative Depth #The game’s storytelling is cinematic and ambitious, featuring long cutscenes, fully voiced dialogue, and complex characters with memorable personalities and motives. Themes of loyalty, identity, and the consequences of warfare are explored through a layered narrative filled with twists and moral ambiguity. Iconic boss battles, each requiring unique tactics, blend gameplay challenge with narrative significance, making every encounter feel meaningful.\nPsycho Mantis Breakthrough #One of the most iconic ones, even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, is the Psycho Mantis one, which can mess around with the controller port that you are using, and even read your memory far information in order to know which games you have been playing recently. And while this may sound like a fun gimmick, it was a ground-breaking feature at the time, not just on a technical level, but also on a more creative one too.\nAged Yet Impactful #Graphically, the game made the most of the PlayStation hardware, creating detailed environments and memorable set pieces, while the sound design, including an atmospheric soundtrack and realistic sound effects, heightens tension and immersion. While modern players may find the tank controls and fixed camera angles somewhat cumbersome, these limitations never detract from the game’s overall impact.\nTimeless Stealth Masterpiece #This game is not just a videogame, it’s an experience that combines stealth gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and unforgettable characters, leaving a lasting influence on the video game industry and inspiring countless games in its wake. This is simply one of the best games of all time, and an absolute must-play even for people that are not really into the stealth genre in general, but if you are at least a bit interested in gaming story-telling. And lastly, there is also a remake for this title, which is not really a good game in comparison, even though the graphics are way better, I still recommend just playing this OG version instead.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-gear-solid/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a landmark in the stealth-action genre, widely regarded as one of the most influential games of its era.","title":"Metal Gear Solid"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 35 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nStunning Retro Presentation #This title is a beautifully crafted homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Golden Sun. Its pixel art is stunning, filled with rich detail, dynamic lighting, and smooth animations that make every location feel alive. The soundtrack, composed by Eric W. Brown and featuring contributions from Yasunori Mitsuda, perfectly complements the game’s nostalgic tone while offering memorable melodies that elevate key moments. Particularly speaking this all may not sound like a big deal, but when it comes to the atmosphere and overall artistic value of this title, this is one of the best out there solely because of it\u0026rsquo;s presentation and OST.\nModernized Turn-Based Combat #The turn-based combat adds modern twists to familiar mechanics, such as timed button presses, combo attacks, and a “locks” system that encourages strategic thinking. This mechanic feels a lot like the ones you see on Mario RPG on the SNES or the Paper Mario on the N64 platforms, it is very satisfying and simple enough to make it engaging. Exploration feels rewarding, with optional activities like fishing, cooking, and puzzle-solving breaking up the pace of the main quest. The world design strikes a balance between linear storytelling and moments of freedom that invite curiosity, especially because it uses things like a world map to explore, with a lot of obviously hidden secrets out in the blue for you to try and find a way there.\nShallow Yet Charming #However, the narrative and character development don’t always reach the same heights as the game’s presentation. This is especially bad because Garl exists, he is so much more charismatic than the rest of the group that it feels unfair. The protagonists are likable but somewhat shallow, and the story’s pacing can feel slow in the early hours. Customization is also limited, with few ways to meaningfully alter your party’s abilities or combat approach over time, though this is a good thing if you prefer focusing on the other elements despite the simplistic combat.\nHeartfelt Classic Tribute #Despite these flaws, this game succeeds as a heartfelt and polished tribute to a beloved era of RPGs. It captures the charm and warmth of its inspirations while offering enough refinement and flair to stand on its own. This is a must-play for anyone who misses the magic of classic adventures told through pixel art and music, especially if you are a fan of the classics. I consider this one of the best RPGs that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, but I just can\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;of all time\u0026rdquo; due to some rough edges, and I know a lot of people ended up disappointed way more than me.\nShared-Universe Adventure #This title also lives inside of the same universe as \u0026ldquo;The Messenger\u0026rdquo;, and it shows, you get immersed on a lot of it\u0026rsquo;s elements if you are familiar and played this one (which I immensely recommend), and it is a nice nostalgic experience. In my opinion, this title is quite amazing, very few games can tackle the challenge of making simple enough RPGs, with good enough elements. Overall it doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow you away in any of it\u0026rsquo;s aspects, but the sum of the elements makes up for an incredible experience. It has some shocking events through the journey but I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil anything since it would ruin the experience.\n","date":"14 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/sea-of-stars/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a beautifully crafted homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Golden Sun.","title":"Sea of Stars"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nFresh Narrative Perspective #This title is an expansion to Valve’s groundbreaking Half-Life and serves as one of the best examples of how to build upon an established classic. Instead of continuing Gordon Freeman’s journey, the MC now is called Adrian Shephard, a U.S. Marine tasked with suppressing the Black Mesa incident. This change of viewpoint not only provides fresh narrative insight but also deepens the world-building of the original story, showing the chaos from another side of the conflict. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly a fan of these kinds of additional contents, telling more about the story, happening at the same time, ever since I first experienced it back in the RE era during PlayStation 1 and 2.\nExpanded Combat Variety #Gameplay-wise, Opposing Force keeps the foundation that made Half-Life so engaging, tight combat, immersive environments, and smart level design, while expanding it with new weapons, enemy types, and even squad-based mechanics, where you can command fellow soldiers for support. The new arsenal and foes keep encounters dynamic, and the pacing feels both challenging and rewarding.\nAtmospheric Classic Expansion #Visually and technically, it retains the Gold Source engine’s strengths, offering atmospheric environments and clever scripted sequences that were impressive for their time. Although shorter and less revolutionary than Half-Life itself, this game succeeds by being a well-crafted, thoughtful, and action-packed expansion that adds real value to the Half-Life universe.

Set before and after the events of the first game, it expands the story through multiple characters and interwoven timelines, painting a grim, chaotic portrait of obsession, violence, and consequence. The game’s pulsing synth soundtrack, composed by a variety of electronic artists, stands out as one of its greatest strengths. Each track heightens the adrenaline and intensity of every encounter. I can\u0026rsquo;t praise the OST enough, it is simply one of the best in gaming history, and not just because I\u0026rsquo;m biased towards the Synthwave genre.\nHypnotic Brutal Gameplay #Combined with the vivid pixel art and neon-soaked visuals, the atmosphere feels hypnotic and unsettling, pushing you into a trance-like state as they fight, die, and repeat. Gameplay remains fast, punishing, and skill-based, demanding quick reflexes and memorization of enemy patterns. The addition of unique playable characters, each with their own abilities and restrictions, adds variety, but also limits the freedom that made the first Hotline Miami so satisfying. And this was a very welcome and needed change because, as much as the story is one of the best that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, the gameplay loop favors a lot from a more in-depth and varied play-styles.\nBigger Levels, New Pace #Many levels are larger and more open, which often leads to frustrating deaths from enemies that attack from off-screen or through windows. This shift in design changes the pace of the game, sometimes making it feel slower and more methodical rather than fluid and instinctive. Narratively, this game is more ambitious but also more fragmented. Its story jumps between perspectives and eras, offering glimpses into the motivations behind the violence but rarely providing clear answers. This second entry escalated the story insanely high, with more characters and timelines to follow, it can sometimes feel confusing, but trust me, it pays off at the end.\nComplex Reflective Finale #While some people appreciate this complex, self-aware approach, others find it confusing and less impactful than the minimalist storytelling of the first game. Still, the game succeeds in creating an oppressive, nightmarish tone that lingers long after it ends. In the end, this videogame is both a celebration and a critique of its predecessor. It doubles down on everything that made the series famous style but also exposes the limits of that formula. It’s not as tightly designed or balanced as the original, yet it is one of the best indie games of all time.\n","date":"13 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/","section":"Posts","summary":"The second entry to Hotline Miami is a louder, harsher, and more ambitious follow-up to the original cult classic.","title":"Hotline Miami 2 Wrong Number"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nChaotic Arcade Continuation #This Metal Slug entry continues SNK’s beloved run-and-gun series with its trademark blend of explosive action, hand-drawn 2D animation, and over-the-top humor.

The controls are as tight and responsive as ever, making every dodge and counterattack feel rewarding. It also introduces a new scoring system that encourages riskier, high-speed play, along with two new playable characters, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey, who add some freshness to the roster.\nVibrant Yet Recycled Visuals #Visually, the game sticks to the vibrant, cartoonish art style the series is known for, with expressive animations and chaotic explosions filling the screen. However, longtime fans will notice that many sprites and backgrounds are recycled from earlier entries, giving it a slightly less polished feel compared to other entries in the series.

There is little to no reason not to play this if you like this kind of game, and if you are a fan of this franchise then this is definitely a must-play, the Metal Slug franchise really have almost no bad games overall.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Metal Slug entry stands as one of the most iconic and ambitious run-and-gun shooters ever made.","title":"Metal Slug 3"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nChaotic Arcade Warfare #This Metal Slug entry marks another explosive entry in SNK’s legendary run-and-gun franchise, maintaining the series’ trademark blend of chaotic action, expressive 2D animation, and tongue-in-cheek humor. This time, the story revolves around the Peregrine Falcon Squad’s battle against a mysterious cult known as the Ptolemaic Army, who have stolen confidential data related to the “Metal Slug Project.”\nRefined Fast-Paced Combat #While the plot is mostly a backdrop for nonstop carnage, it adds a slightly darker and more mechanical tone compared to earlier, more lighthearted titles. Gameplay remains fast, precise, and incredibly satisfying, every shot, explosion, and enemy encounter feels weighty and responsive. The new “slide” move adds a small but meaningful twist to the classic formula, giving players a new way to dodge bullets and close gaps.\nNew Visual Highlights #The introduction of the Slug Gunner, a heavily armed, transformable vehicle, provides another layer of variety to the familiar formula. Visually, it is as impressive as ever, showcasing SNK’s mastery of pixel art. The backgrounds feature detailed industrial complexes and jungle ruins, animated with the series’ usual flair. The soundtrack leans into heavier rock influences, matching the game’s grittier tone and keeping the adrenaline high throughout the campaign.\nShort but Satisfying #However, the game’s biggest drawback is its brevity, it feels noticeably shorter and less polished than previous entries like Metal Slug 3 or 4. Some stages lack the branching paths and imaginative set pieces that defined the earlier titles, and the boss fights, while flashy, don’t quite reach the same level of creativity. Still, this game delivers what fans expect: intense, over-the-top action wrapped in gorgeous 2D animation. It may not be the most ambitious or memorable chapter in the series, but it’s a solid and entertaining ride for anyone who loves classic arcade shooters.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-5/","section":"Posts","summary":"This entry maintains the series\u0026rsquo; trademark blend of chaotic action, expressive 2D animation, and tongue-in-cheek humor.","title":"Metal Slug 5"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 2 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nCharming Run-and-Gun Origins #The very first Metal Slug entry is a fast-paced run-and-gun game that captures the charm of the original arcade version. The game features detailed, hand-drawn sprites and smooth animations, giving it a distinct personality with humorous enemy behaviors and interactive environments. The gameplay is engaging, with a variety of weapons, destructible scenery, POW rescues, and the iconic SV‑001 tank sections adding depth and excitement.\nExpanded PlayStation Content #The PlayStation release includes bonus modes like “Combat School” and mini-games, as well as galleries that showcase the art and animations, giving fans extra content beyond the arcade experience. The combination of fast action, humor, and visual flair makes it a memorable game even on the aging PlayStation hardware.\nNotable Port Drawbacks #However, the port has its drawbacks, load times interrupt the action, some animations are simplified or missing, and certain audio elements lack the crispness of the arcade original. The difficulty ramps up sharply in later stages, and the overall length is relatively short, making replayability dependent on score-chasing or cooperative play.\nEnduring Retro Appeal #Despite these limitations, the game holds up well for retro gamers. Its humor, style, and explosive action remain entertaining, making it a worthwhile experience for fans of classic run-and-gun games, even if the PS1 version is not the definitive edition. Even though this is the most limited one since it was the very first implementations and ideas, it is really one of the best games of all time, proving how good this formula was.\n","date":"10 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001/","section":"Posts","summary":"The very first Metal Slug entry is a fast-paced run-and-gun game that captures the charm of the original arcade version.","title":"Metal Slug Super Vehicle 001"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 25 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Dark Reboot #This Castlevania entry is a cinematic reboot of the long-running series that reimagines it as a dark fantasy action-adventure rather than a traditional exploration-based platformer. Set in a mythic world of crumbling ruins, cursed forests, and colossal beasts, the MC is called Gabriel Belmont on a tragic quest that mixes gothic atmosphere with epic storytelling. The game’s presentation is its strongest suit, it looks beautiful even years later, with detailed environments, sweeping camera angles, and an emotional orchestral score that elevates every scene. Combat is satisfying and weighty, combining whip attacks, magic powers, and timed dodges in a way that feels close to God of War or Dante’s Inferno.\nEpic Yet Linear #Boss fights, particularly the massive titan battles, deliver some of the game’s most memorable moments. The voice acting gives surprising gravitas to the story, which grows more interesting the deeper it goes. However, the game’s linear structure can disappoint longtime fans expecting the exploration and backtracking typical of older Castlevania titles. Some camera angles are awkward, making platforming sections frustrating, and the pacing sometimes dips between combat encounters and puzzles. It also borrows heavily from its contemporaries, offering polish rather than innovation.\nSpectacle Over Exploration #Overall, this game succeeds as a cinematic, emotionally charged reinvention of the series. It trades open exploration for spectacle and storytelling, delivering a grand adventure that’s both haunting and beautiful. For people who enjoy mythic narratives and stylish combat, it’s a strong experience worth revisiting, even if it feels more God of War than Castlevania. Particularly this is the only game that I have Platinum status back in the PlayStation 3 era, and I highly recommend trying to 100% this one, it is very satisfying. Although this title was not very well received by the community, I really like it and I highly recommend it to fans of the series, or if you like Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash games to any extent, it is simply one of the best of the genre.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/castlevania-lords-of-shadow/","section":"Posts","summary":"A cinematic reboot of the long-running series that reimagines it as a dark fantasy action-adventure.","title":"Castlevania Lords of Shadow"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nTense Atmospheric Action #This title is a strong expansion that successfully captures the tense, oppressive atmosphere that made the original game stand out. The game continues to blend psychological horror with intense first-person shooter action, creating moments of genuine suspense. Dark, claustrophobic corridors, unsettling sound effects, and sudden supernatural occurrences keep players constantly on edge, while the signature “reflex time” mechanic allows for cinematic gunplay that rewards skill and timing.\nFresh Combat Additions #The expansion adds a variety of new weapons and enemy types, keeping combat engaging throughout its run. Levels are carefully designed to maintain a sense of dread while introducing new environments, such as abandoned hospitals, underground tunnels, and eerie industrial areas. The enemy AI remains intelligent and adaptive, often flanking or taking cover, which adds a layer of challenge that complements the horror-driven pacing.\nMinimal Narrative Progress #Despite these strengths, the story of Extraction Point is minimal and largely feels like an extension of the original game rather than a meaningful continuation. The plot doesn’t introduce significant twists or expand the FEAR lore in any notable way, which may disappoint players seeking a deeper narrative experience. Additionally, the campaign is relatively short, generally lasting around 4~6 hours, and some people may feel that the expansion offers little in terms of innovation beyond new levels and weapons.\nConsistent Yet Limited #Visually and mechanically, the game remains consistent with the original entry, which is both a strength and a limitation. Fans of the base game will appreciate the familiar style and polished combat, but those looking for significant changes or improvements might find it lacking. Nevertheless, it succeeds in delivering more of the suspenseful, adrenaline-fueled action that defined the original, making it a worthwhile experience for dedicated fans.\nSolid Horror Expansion #Overall, this game is a competent and atmospheric expansion that extends the horror and action of the original game. While it may not break new ground in terms of story or innovation, it provides enough intense combat, tense moments, and eerie environments to satisfy fans looking for a continuation of the base game experience.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-extraction-point/","section":"Posts","summary":"A strong expansion that successfully captures the tense, oppressive atmosphere that made the original game stand out.","title":"FEAR Extraction Point"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nAction-Heavy Continuation #This title is a standalone expansion that continues the series’ blend of tactical gunfights and supernatural tension, though it leans much more toward action than horror. You step into the role of a new Point Man leading a Delta Force squad through yet another Armacham facility, uncovering a parallel storyline to the events of the original game. The core mechanics remain intact, the iconic slow-motion “reflex time,” responsive controls, and intense firefights against clever enemy AI are still the best reasons to play.\nSatisfying Yet Stale #The gunplay feels satisfying and weighty, with realistic physics and impactful effects that make every encounter a spectacle of chaos. New weapons like the lightning arc and grenade launcher bring some freshness to combat, and facing new enemy types like the Nightcrawlers keeps things from feeling too stale. Despite these strengths, this expansion suffers from a noticeable lack of innovation. The environments are familiar, mostly grey corridors, warehouses, and abandoned offices, and by 2007, the visuals were already looking outdated.\nDiminished Horror Presence #The horror elements that once defined FEAR are toned down significantly, replaced with a focus on relentless shooting that undermines the eerie atmosphere of the original. The story, which runs alongside the first game rather than expanding it, adds little to the narrative and struggles to leave a lasting impression. Even the pacing feels uneven, alternating between strong combat sections and repetitive exploration through uninspired settings.\nCompetent but Unremarkable #Overall, this game is a competent but unremarkable expansion. It delivers satisfying combat and smooth mechanics, but it also feels like a retread of ideas already perfected in the base game. For fans hungry for more of FEAR’s intense firefights, it provides a few hours of solid action. But those hoping for a richer story, stronger scares, or technical improvements will find it more of a reminder of how good the original was, rather than a true evolution of it.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-perseus-mandate/","section":"Posts","summary":"A standalone expansion that continues the series\u0026rsquo; blend of tactical gunfights and supernatural tension.","title":"FEAR Perseus Mandate"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 17 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nProcedural Descent Mastery #This title is a brilliant blend of roguelike randomness and classic platforming precision. It challenges you to descend through procedurally generated caves filled with traps, treasures, and deadly creatures, all while managing limited resources and quick reflexes. Every run feels unique, with the game’s procedural design ensuring no two adventures ever play out the same way.\nPrecision and Discovery #Its controls are tight and responsive, making every death feel like your own fault rather than bad luck. While the difficulty can be brutal, it’s also deeply rewarding: you learn by failing, slowly mastering its many hazards and secrets. The pixel art style is charming yet deceptive, hiding a world full of complexity and surprising depth. The soundtrack perfectly complements the sense of exploration and tension as you dig deeper.\nChaos Becomes Strategy #What makes this videogame so timeless is how it turns chaos into strategy, teaching you to think ahead, take risks, and adapt on the fly. With endless replay value, hidden levels, and a fair-but-punishing design philosophy, it remains one of the most influential indie games of its era. You can spend a lot of hours playing this, finish it, and it\u0026rsquo;ll leave you wanting more.\nA Tough Indie Classic #Not to mention that there are some fun achievements to unlock if you want 100% to make this more interesting. This game is a tough but beautifully designed roguelike-platformer that rewards persistence and creativity. A true classic in modern indie gaming, and a must-play if you like indie titles to any extent.

Set in a steampunk-inspired world filled with hand-drawn environments, it tells its story entirely without dialogue, relying instead on environmental cues, animation, and visual storytelling. The atmosphere is rich and mysterious, supported by a beautifully painted art style and an evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the tone. What made me want to play this was it\u0026rsquo;s artstyle, that while unique, it continues to be it\u0026rsquo;s strongest point when compared to the other mechanics.\nCreative but Frustrating #The game’s magnetic mechanics are both its greatest strength and main challenge. You must use attraction and repulsion to navigate puzzles and traverse complex environments, which can feel rewarding when mastered. However, the physics-based controls sometimes lack precision, and a few of the later puzzles or boss fights can become frustrating due to their high difficulty and reliance on trial and error. By far the weakest aspect are the boss fights, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel natural or engaging enough, it was a nice try to implement a more traditional element into the game.\nCharming Yet Imperfect #Despite these rough edges, Teslagrad stands out as a creative and atmospheric indie title. Its unique mechanics, visual charm, and wordless storytelling make it memorable, even if its short length and occasional frustration prevent it from reaching true greatness. I can\u0026rsquo;t say this is a bad experience, but I also cannot praise this more than I wish I could, it is a nice and unique indie title, reserved for fans of the indie scene if you, like me, consider yourself one.\n","date":"9 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/teslagrad/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a 2D puzzle-platformer that revolves around the manipulation of magnetism.","title":"Teslagrad"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 40 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nModernized Survival Horror #This RE entry successfully modernizes the classic survival horror experience while keeping the essence of the original intact. The gameplay feels smoother and more responsive, with improved aiming, refined controls, and smarter enemy AI that heightens tension throughout the game. Exploration and combat are better balanced, making both action and horror sequences more engaging. It is impressive how they managed to modernize this and bring a lot of QOL improvements, since the original title was almost perfect when it comes to this, this remake essentially did the exact same thing it\u0026rsquo;s original did back then.\nAtmospheric Visual Overhaul #Visually, the game is impressive, enhanced lighting, detailed textures, and atmospheric environments create a sense of dread and immersion that amplifies the horror experience. The remake also introduces new or reworked areas and story elements, adding depth without straying too far from the iconic moments that fans remember. And fortunately this time, this game didn\u0026rsquo;t cut any content at all, which was a big complain people had for the Remake of Nemesis. It is quite the opposite this time around, we got new content to enjoy.\nFaithful, Tense Reimagining #Additionally, some optional missions and side content can feel repetitive or less engaging, and a few changes to characters and cutscenes may divide longtime fans. Escort sequences with Ashley, while improved, can still be frustrating in certain combat situations. Overall, this game is a faithful and polished reimagining that blends nostalgia with modern gameplay improvements. It’s highly recommended for both newcomers and fans of the original, offering a tense, atmospheric, and action-packed survival horror experience.

Built on the same engine as Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, it delivers smooth, responsive movement and a surprising sense of vertical freedom for its time. Swinging between rooftops, crawling along walls, and taking down enemies with webs felt exciting and fresh in an era when superhero games were often clunky or uninspired.\nComic-Style Storytelling #The story, narrated by the legendary Stan Lee, unfolds like a living comic book, filled with colorful dialogue, dynamic cutscenes, and a host of familiar faces from the Spider-Man universe, Venom, Carnage, Scorpion, Rhino, and Doctor Octopus all make memorable appearances. The tone balances humor, action, and classic comic book drama in a way that appeals to both kids and longtime fans.\nTimeless Nostalgic Adventure #Though the city is covered in a mysterious fog that hides the lack of a ground-level world, and the graphics now show their age, the gameplay remains surprisingly engaging. The mix of combat, puzzles, stealth, and boss battles keeps things varied across its short but replayable campaign.

You need to save Mario, Luigi, and Toad that were kidnapped by Bowser, armed not with fireballs, but with her emotions. The game’s central gimmick, the “Vibe Scepter,” lets Peach channel her feelings, joy, rage, gloom, and calm, to affect the environment and solve puzzles. It’s a creative system that gives the game a distinct identity, even if it sometimes leans too heavily on the emotional theme for humor.\nColorful, Gentle Platforming #Visually, the game shines with colorful, storybook-style graphics and a cheerful soundtrack that fits the DS’s bright aesthetic. Levels are easy to navigate, and the platforming feels smooth and forgiving, making it approachable for younger audiences. However, seasoned fans may find the difficulty too low and the gameplay loop somewhat repetitive after a while. I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly hate this title being easy, sometimes it is good to have a more lightweight experience such as this one.\nCharming Lighthearted Journey #Despite these flaws, this game remains an enjoyable and lighthearted adventure that gives its long-overlooked heroine a well-deserved starring role. It’s not the most challenging platformer, but it’s one of the most charming and unique entries in the Mario universe. I would only recommend this for fans of the Mario franchise, it is a very pleasant experience, but it is not as special as the mainline games of the series.\n","date":"8 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/super-princess-peach/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title offers a charming reversal of the classic Mario formula by casting Princess Peach as the hero for once.","title":"Super Princess Peach"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 40 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nFaithful Sci-Fi Reimagining #This remake is a faithful reimagining of the 1994 classic, carefully modernized while preserving its eerie atmosphere and complex design.

And this level of quality can be said through all Nightdive games, this is one of the best companies when it comes to remakes and remasters, I highly recommend almost all of their games.\nShodan’s Haunting Presence #The villain is called Shodan, reinforcing the game’s dark sci-fi identity and lending weight to its storytelling through audio logs and environmental details. While the remake modernizes many systems, it still retains a distinctly old-school feel. Combat can be clunky, with melee encounters lacking precision and impact, and the cyberspace sections remain divisive due to their awkward controls and pacing. I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly mind the cyberspace section, but they are definitely not the greatest gameplay mechanic this game has to offer.\nA Restored Classic #Overall, this game is a loving and ambitious restoration of a foundational immersive sim. It successfully bridges the gap between retro design and modern expectations, delivering a moody, challenging experience that rewards curiosity and patience. For fans of atmospheric sci-fi and immersive storytelling, it’s a fitting return to one of gaming’s most influential worlds.

Instead of running and jumping in the traditional sense, the player warps between surfaces, floor, walls, and ceilings, creating a distinctive flow and rhythm in exploration and combat. This mechanic gives the game a fresh feel within the genre.\nAtmospheric Brazilian Influence #The game excels in atmosphere, featuring detailed pixel art and haunting sound design that immerse the player in the surreal world of Salt. Exploration is rewarding, with secrets, upgrades, and hidden paths that encourage curiosity. The game also carries subtle Brazilian cultural influences, adding personality and depth to its artistic presentation. I\u0026rsquo;m biased since this is my home country, but I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this title enough if you have any curiosity regarding our culture and folklore.\nChallenging Movement Drawbacks #However, the unconventional movement can feel imprecise, especially in combat or tight platforming sections, leading to occasional frustration. It is also relatively short, and some sections in the mid-to-late-game can feel punishing due to spikes in difficulty. The story is minimal, serving more as a backdrop than a narrative driver, which may disappoint people looking for strong storytelling.\nStandout Indie Metroidvania #Overall, this game is a memorable indie Metroidvania that stands out for its movement mechanics, aesthetic, and exploration. It’s best suited for people who enjoy challenge, discovery, and unique gameplay experiences, even if it occasionally tests patience.

Its narrative depth is complemented by well-developed characters, each with unique abilities and motivations, making the journey feel personal and engaging.\nStrategic Djinn Combat #Combat shines thanks to the innovative Djinn system. By collecting and assigning elemental Djinn to characters, players can customize classes, unlock powerful abilities, and experiment with different strategies, keeping battles consistently rewarding. And while this mechanic didn\u0026rsquo;t changed a bit when compared to the first title, it is still very well implemented and executed. Though it has a couple of secrets you can unfold compared to the first entry, related to this mechanic which can lead you to having to replay the entire game if you are not careful enough, it can lock you out of an optional dungeon.\nClever Puzzles \u0026amp; Atmosphere #The game’s puzzles are cleverly integrated into the environment, often requiring observation, logic, and clever use of Psynergy (magic) to solve, making exploration feel both challenging and satisfying. Visually, the game is a showcase for the GBA, with detailed sprites, vibrant landscapes, and smooth animations. The soundtrack enhances the atmosphere with memorable melodies that range from adventurous and uplifting to mysterious and haunting, perfectly supporting the story’s tone.

The game’s pixel art, chiptune soundtrack, and grim tone perfectly capture the feel of 8-bit era games while adding a touch of modern polish. Its tight combat, brutal difficulty, and exploration-heavy structure make it both challenging and rewarding for players who enjoy mastering precise mechanics and uncovering secrets.\nMeaningful Morality Choices #What makes Infernax stand out is its morality system, which allows you to make choices that affect quests, story outcomes, and even the game’s endings. This layer of consequence adds replayability and gives depth to what could otherwise be a straightforward retro homage. Each decision feels weighty, and the different paths encourage multiple playthroughs. The game also features optional modern assists, such as easier difficulty modes and save points, making it more accessible than many of the old-school titles it emulates.\nOld-School Challenge Returns #This may sound like a strange thing to mention since most titles nowadays have these features as standards, but back in the day, you almost always needed to play the whole game in a sitting, or rely on passwords of some kind. However, this game can be punishing early on, with tough enemies and unforgiving platforming sections that may frustrate less patient people. Some design elements intentionally mimic the clunky quirks of older games, which might not appeal to everyone, fortunately for me, this is not a big deal.

The once-bustling research facility has been overrun by the Typhon, a shape-shifting alien species capable of mimicking everyday objects. From the moment you step into the station, Prey captures you with its unsettling mood, smart level design, and an overarching sense of isolation and mystery.\nTalos I World-Building #Talos I itself is the true star of the game. Every section of the station feels distinct, from luxurious corporate offices to claustrophobic maintenance tunnels, and everything is connected in a way that rewards backtracking and exploration. Arkane’s trademark world-building shines here, as even minor details, emails, audio logs, and environmental clues, flesh out the lives of the crew and the tragedy that befell them. There’s an impressive freedom in how you can navigate and interact with the world, whether you choose to hack locked doors, use alien abilities to transform into small objects, or simply find alternate physical routes using your tools.\nFlexible Gameplay Builds #The gameplay systems encourage experimentation and creativity, you can build your character with human skills like engineering and hacking or embrace alien powers such as telekinesis and mimicry. And this system is complex enough to lock you in a certain \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo;, you cannot make yourself overpowered by leveling up each and every ability, instead you need to choose a playstyle and stick to it in order to it effective enough to be worth it. Each choice affects how you approach challenges and how other characters perceive you.\nIngenious Tools \u0026amp; Design #The GLOO Cannon, a versatile tool that can freeze enemies or create climbable platforms, is emblematic of Prey’s ingenuity, nearly every item in the game can serve multiple purposes depending on your imagination. This is by far the most useful weapon you\u0026rsquo;ll be using, I used this quite a lot, from the start, to the very end of the game, it never stops being useful, especially to clean out weaker enemies, and there is a whole lot of them. Visually, it is striking without relying on photorealism. The soundtrack enhances the tension perfectly, mixing eerie ambient sounds with sudden bursts of energy during combat.\nUneven but Engaging Combat #Despite its strengths, Prey has a few shortcomings, the combat, while serviceable, often feels clunky and less polished than the exploration or puzzle-solving aspects. Early encounters with Mimics can be tense and terrifying, but later battles sometimes drag due to repetitive enemy types and resource scarcity. The pacing can also slow down in the middle portion, where objectives become less urgent and the story loses some of its early momentum. While the ending offers interesting twists, it feels somewhat abrupt compared to the depth of the journey that precedes it.\nUnderappreciated Immersive Sim #Ultimately, this game stands as one of the most underappreciated sci-fi games of the last decade. It challenges the you to think, explore, and experiment rather than simply shoot their way through. With its layered storytelling, immersive environments, and deep mechanics, it captures the spirit of classic immersive sims like System Shock and Deus Ex while carving out its own identity. Prey may not be flawless, but it’s a rich and rewarding experience that continues to resonate with those who appreciate atmosphere, freedom, and thoughtful design in their games.

The game emphasized realism and teamwork, rewarding stealth playstyles, strategy, and coordination rather than brute force. Its single-player campaign featured diverse global missions, each requiring careful planning and precise execution.\nStrengths and Shortcomings #Despite its strengths, the game wasn’t without flaws, the single-player AI could be inconsistent, with teammates sometimes behaving unpredictably. The difficulty level was steep, and the lack of frequent checkpoints made failure punishing. Still, these issues did little to overshadow its achievements. SOCOM II combined tactical gameplay, realism, and atmosphere in a way that few console shooters of the time managed.\nEnduring Legacy Today #Even today, it remains a nostalgic favorite among fans of tactical shooters. Though its online servers were shut down in 2012, its legacy lives on through fan projects and its influence on later tactical and military shooters. This game stands as a defining example of what made the PlayStation 2 era so special, innovation, challenge, and unforgettable multiplayer experiences.

Every world feels alive with soft, colorful details, while the gentle soundtrack complements the visual warmth, creating one of the most relaxing experiences on the Super Nintendo.\nCompanions and Exploration #Gameplay stays true to Kirby’s roots but introduces new layers of depth through his animal companions, Rick, Coo, Kine, and others, each offering unique twists on Kirby’s abilities and altering how you explore levels. Collecting Heart Stars by helping friendly NPCs adds a light puzzle-solving element that rewards patience and curiosity rather than raw skill.\nA Gentle Farewell #While it’s not a particularly challenging game, its slower pace and forgiving design make it perfect for people who value creativity and atmosphere over intensity.

The car combat feels dynamic and satisfying, making each encounter a thrilling experience.

It marked a bold leap into open-world design, moving away from the series’ traditionally linear structure. Set during the Cold War era in the mid-1980s, players assume the role of Venom Snake as he rebuilds the private army “Diamond Dogs” and seeks revenge against those who destroyed his previous base. The story begins with an explosive hospital escape sequence, setting a dramatic tone that gradually gives way to a more player-driven, sandbox-style experience.\nUnmatched Tactical Freedom #What immediately sets this title apart is its incredible gameplay freedom. Every mission unfolds like a tactical puzzle with countless possible solutions. You can infiltrate outposts at night using tranquilizers and stealth camouflage, or storm enemy camps with air support and heavy weapons. The tools at your disposal, from Fulton extraction devices and decoy dummies to vehicles, companions, and custom-built weapons, encourage experimentation. The AI responds dynamically to your tactics: use too many headshots, and enemies start wearing helmets; rely on night missions, and they’ll deploy flashlights and night-vision gear.\nAdaptive Systems \u0026amp; Progression #This adaptive challenge keeps the experience fresh and constantly evolving, and this was an impressive feat at the time, especially because of the saturated stealth mechanics of the triple A titles at the time, this ended up setting new standards for this genre. The Mother Base system adds another layer of depth, connecting the your fieldwork to broader management gameplay. And personally speaking, I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of base-building mechanics in general, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t get in m way in any way, so if you also don\u0026rsquo;t like those, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;ll get bothered by it. Soldiers captured in the field can be recruited, resources gathered can be used to expand facilities, and new technologies can be developed to enhance your arsenal.\nStunning World Design #This sense of progression gives real purpose to exploration and side operations, making even smaller missions feel rewarding. Combined with the game’s smooth, responsive controls and top-tier stealth mechanics, this videogame delivers one of the most refined gameplay loops ever seen in the genre. Visually, the game is stunning, the Fox Engine enables beautiful lighting, realistic animations, and seamless transitions between environments. Whether sneaking through the rocky deserts of Afghanistan or the humid jungles of Central Africa, each location feels alive and detailed.\nStrong Gameplay, Weak Story #The inclusion of licensed 1980s music, which you can play from a Walkman during missions, adds nostalgic personality and helps lighten the often serious tone. However, the game’s narrative doesn’t live up to its mechanical brilliance. While the early chapters are filled with intrigue, emotional moments, and classic Metal Gear eccentricity, the story loses focus toward the end. Many plotlines feel unfinished, and some key revelations are delivered abruptly or through optional cassette tapes rather than cinematic cutscenes. Particularly, the worst example is the Liquid Snake side-mission, which presents us with this iconic character in the franchise, just to not finish it\u0026rsquo;s story-line.\nCut Content \u0026amp; Repetition #A lot of people were particularly disappointed by the lack of a proper ending and the omission of certain missions that were reportedly cut before release. This results in a lingering sense that The Phantom Pain was never truly completed, despite its remarkable polish elsewhere. Repetition is another issue that surfaces in the later stages. As the narrative pacing slows, you are often asked to replay earlier missions with new conditions or higher difficulty settings. While this does highlight the game’s flexible mission design, it can also feel like artificial padding.\nMasterclass in Stealth Design #Nevertheless, even repeated missions remain engaging thanks to the depth of the underlying systems and the sheer number of ways each encounter can play out. Despite these shortcomings, this game remains a masterclass in open-world game design. It successfully blends stealth, strategy, and action into a cohesive, highly replayable experience that rewards your creativity at every turn. Its mechanics are so refined that many consider it one of the best stealth-action games ever made, even if its narrative doesn’t provide the emotional or thematic closure fans hoped for.\nBittersweet Mechanical Masterpiece #A lot of people, including myself, consider this to be the ultimate stealth and espionage game of all time, there is little to no game that can even come close to the depth of the mechanics this title introduced, it is simply the ultimate sandbox of this genre. Ultimately, this MGS entry is a bittersweet masterpiece, an unfinished epic whose gameplay excellence overshadows its incomplete story. It represents both the peak of mechanical design and the limits of creative freedom within a major studio production. It still remains as one of the best games of all time, through almost all of it\u0026rsquo;s mechanics and the story it is trying to convey, this is truly a must-play masterpiece in gaming.\n","date":"6 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Metal Gear Solid entry stands as both a technical marvel and a divisive milestone in this legendary stealth series.","title":"Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRetro Cyber-Ninja Style #This title is a 2D action-platformer developed by JoyMasher, the studio behind Blazing Chrome, I\u0026rsquo;ll forever recommend this company, it has amazing titles, not to mention it is from my homeland. It’s a deliberate throwback to the 16-bit era, evoking classics like Mega Man X, Strider, and Shinobi. The MC is a cybernetic ninja who turns against its creators and fights through a series of themed stages filled with enemies, traps, and bosses. The game’s presentation nails its retro inspirations, with sharp pixel art, fluid animations, and an energetic synth soundtrack that perfectly captures the mood of a dystopian, futuristic rebellion.\nTight, Engaging Gameplay #Gameplay is tight and responsive, emphasizing precise movement, well-timed attacks, and pattern recognition. Each boss you defeat grants new abilities, while collectible “modifier chips” let you tweak your playstyle, adding a touch of modern customization. Though don\u0026rsquo;t expect a high level of depth, it is just enough to make this interesting and engaging beyond mindlessly going forward, but it is nice to have, it is a nice and needed addition to the simplistic formula of these kinds of games. The difficulty curve is fair, challenging but rarely frustrating, offering just enough resistance to keep you engaged without slipping into unfair territory.\nShort but Satisfying #The main downside is the game’s short duration, with only a handful of stages, most people can finish it in a few hours, and there isn’t much incentive to replay beyond experimenting with upgrades or chasing higher ranks. While its mechanics are solid, this game doesn’t do much to innovate beyond its influences, which makes it feel more like a tribute than a reinvention, and this is not necessarily a bad thing if the execution is high quality, which is the case for this title.

This mechanic adds strategic depth and helps keep combat varied while you explore Dracula’s castle and its magical portrait worlds.\nAtmospheric Visuals And Sound #The game stands out for its strong presentation. Sprites are detailed and fluid, the gothic backdrops remain atmospheric, and the soundtrack mixes classic Castlevania themes with new tracks that capture each area’s tone. The portrait mechanic is also clever, transporting you into alternate environments beyond the castle, which keeps exploration fresh in the first half of the game.\nRepetitive Levels And Story #On the downside, the level design leans heavily on repetition, especially later on when portraits reuse tile sets and room layouts. The story, set during World War II, introduces intriguing elements like vampire sisters and supernatural conflict, but the writing and character depth are limited. Difficulty is more forgiving than in some earlier entries, which can make the game feel less rewarding to series veterans. Overall, this game is a solid and enjoyable Castlevania entry.\nMemorable DS Castlevania #It may not reach the heights of Dawn of Sorrow or the refinement of Order of Ecclesia, but its dual-character system, strong visuals, and excellent soundtrack make it a memorable part of the DS trilogy and a worthwhile experience for fans of the series. This is definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, and I really enjoyed the unique dual-character mechanic, it is one of the best implementations of the unique console that was the Nintendo DS (and also it\u0026rsquo;s sequel, the Nintendo 3DS).\n","date":"3 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/castlevania-portrait-of-ruin/","section":"Posts","summary":"The second entry of the DS Castlevanias that builds on the series\u0026rsquo; Metroidvania foundation with a dual-character system.","title":"Castlevania Portrait of Ruin"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 45 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nModern JRPG Nostalgia #This title is a love letter to classic JRPGs, evoking the style of the SNES and PlayStation era while modernizing the experience with quality-of-life improvements.

The inclusion of mech-based encounters adds another layer of strategy and variety, keeping the game from feeling repetitive.\nStunning Visuals \u0026amp; Sound #Visually, the game’s pixel art is beautiful, with richly detailed environments and fluid animations that complement its sweeping fantasy setting. The soundtrack is another highlight, often praised for its atmosphere and ability to capture the emotional tone of each scene. Content-wise, it’s a lengthy adventure filled with side quests, character interactions, and hidden secrets, offering anywhere from 30 to 50 hours of playtime.\nStory And Mechanics Flaws #Not everything lands perfectly, though. The story, while engaging, suffers from uneven pacing and some unresolved threads by the end. The Overdrive mechanic, while fresh, can at times feel restrictive, forcing you to make choices just to manage the meter rather than following their preferred strategies.

At its core, it retains the round-based, team-oriented gameplay that emphasizes precision gunplay, map control, and economy management, where every bullet and purchase decision can influence the outcome of a match. What sets CS:GO apart is how it manages to stay true to this identity while expanding the experience with refreshed visuals, updated weapon handling, and new game modes like Arms Race and Demolition, which offered quicker, more accessible ways to enjoy the game outside of its traditional competitive setting.\nCommunity And Competitive Growth #The game initially had a modest reception, with some fans skeptical about its changes compared to Counter-Strike: Source or 1.6, but Valve’s ongoing support through updates and balance tweaks helped CS:GO evolve steadily. The introduction of weapon skins and cosmetic items, along with regular content drops, not only kept the player base engaged but also fueled an entire trading and community economy. Its maps, both classic and new, became arenas for strategy and skill mastery, and the competitive scene around CS:GO grew into one of the most significant in esports history.\nHigh Skill Mastery #This game’s appeal lies in its high skill ceiling and unforgiving nature, making it a challenging experience for newcomers but endlessly rewarding for more dedicated people. The simplicity of its objectives, plant or defuse the bomb, eliminate the enemy team, belies the incredible depth that comes from its mechanics, teamwork dynamics, and tactical variety. Over the years, it became more than just a game; it’s a cultural phenomenon that continues to shape the landscape of competitive shooters, proving that Valve’s mix of refinement and community-driven evolution can keep a title relevant for over a decade.

The game’s standout feature is its atmosphere: lush backgrounds, detailed sprite work, and smooth animations create a believable sense of adventure that was impressive for its era. The level design encourages exploration, with hidden paths and collectible treasures that reward curiosity and replay.\nChallenging Platforming Combat #Gameplay is a mix of precise platforming and combat. Harry Jr. is equipped with both a whip and a slingshot, giving you multiple ways to handle enemies ranging from wild animals to mystical guardians. However, the controls can feel loose at times, leading to some frustrating deaths, especially during sections filled with spikes, traps, or enemies placed near tricky jumps. The difficulty can be uneven, but the challenge adds to the sense of danger that defines the experience.\nRespectful Retro Revival #What makes the game especially charming is its respect for its roots: you can even unlock the original Pitfall as a hidden bonus, which ties the series’ legacy together. While it didn’t quite reach the same level of acclaim as other platformers of the 16-bit generation, this game remains a fun, atmospheric, and ambitious reimagining of a gaming classic.

The combat system refines the Souls formula, offering a huge variety of weapons, spells, and builds that allow people to approach challenges in different ways.

The sheer amount of optional content, from side areas to multiple endings, gives the game incredible replay value and freedom of choice.\nReplay Value Strengths #By far this is the biggest standout for me, and this made me play the game, from start to finish, two entire times, and also to mess around with alternative playstyles and classes along the way. And as much as the other titles of the same company also have this feature, by far ER is the one with the most advanced replay value up to this day, not only when it comes to FS titles, but Souls-likes in general. On the downside, the PC version suffered from performance issues at launch, with stuttering and inconsistent frame rates, though patches have improved stability over time. Some mechanics, such as mounted combat and certain movement systems, can feel clunky, and the game’s lack of guidance can make it overwhelming for newcomers. Still, these drawbacks do little to diminish the overall experience, while at the same time, the lack of sign-posting can be a good thing, since this resembles how gaming worked back in the day, for example, in the SNES era.\nFreedom and Mastery #This kind of approach promotes freedom and curiosity, in order to advance forward, the only possible strategy is to always keep moving. Ultimately, this game is a masterpiece of open-world design and a must-play for fans of challenging, atmospheric RPGs. It demands patience and persistence but rewards players with one of the most immersive and memorable adventures in modern gaming. This is definitely one of the best games of all time, and a landmark in the action-RPG genre, which was starting to become saturated with less and less inspiring games. I absolutely consider this a must-play, for everybody, not just for fans of Souls-likes, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t manage to beat it, or if you can\u0026rsquo;t get past the first few areas of the game, you\u0026rsquo;ll still have an amazing experience while doing so.\nSimple Classes Viable #Particularly speaking, I started off playing with the Samurai class, from start to finish, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really like to change much of the stock character.

And lastly, yet to this day, I still have not played the DLC, but I plan on doing so, and I highly recommend doing 100% of this game.

The MC is called Alma, an automaton warrior in a world where machines are losing their sentience because the life-giving resource, Anima, is running out. This sets the stage for a story full of urgency and difficult choices, as every character has limited time before becoming “unsighted,” a mindless husk.\nChoices Under Time #The game’s strongest feature is its time mechanic. NPCs have real in-game timers, forcing you to decide who to save and who you might have to sacrifice. This gives emotional weight to exploration and replayability, with multiple endings depending on your actions. Combat is another highlight: fast, responsive, and skill-based, with parries, melee weapons, and guns creating a satisfying flow.\nStriking Cyberpunk Atmosphere #Its pixel art, atmosphere, and music also stand out, making the world both beautiful and haunting. Despite it\u0026rsquo;s main standout for me being the time mechanic, and it\u0026rsquo;s story, I also consider it\u0026rsquo;s vibe to be one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced. But I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I love Cyebrpunk and Synthwave, so if you are also into this sort of thing, than this is definitely a must-play.\nStressful Time Pressure #However, the ticking clock won’t appeal to everyone. The constant pressure can feel stressful, discouraging leisurely exploration or full completion. Some areas suffer from confusing platforming and navigation, while occasional difficulty spikes can frustrate. The writing and pacing can also feel uneven, with moments of filler dialogue or mechanics that don’t land as well as others.\nUnique Indie Standout #Overall, this game is a distinctive and memorable indie adventure. It blends solid combat, emotional storytelling, and unique urgency in a way that few games attempt. For people who enjoy tension and meaningful decision-making, it’s a hidden gem, but those looking for a relaxed Metroidvania experience may find its time pressure overwhelming. This is definitely one of the best indies that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I highly recommend looking into the next work of the same developers, called \u0026ldquo;Abyss X Zero\u0026rdquo; if you liked this one, I\u0026rsquo;m very excited to play it.\n","date":"2 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/unsighted/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a top-down action adventure and Metroidvania developed by Brazilian indie studio Pixel Punk.","title":"Unsighted"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 7 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nStylish Cyberpunk Horror #The first entry to the Fear Effect franchise is a stylish action-adventure game that is best remembered for its striking cel-shaded visual style and cinematic presentation, which stood out at the time. The story mixes cyberpunk and supernatural themes, following mercenaries on a dark, neon-soaked journey through futuristic Hong Kong and into the Chinese underworld. Gameplay combines puzzle-solving with third-person shooting, though the fixed camera angles and tank-like controls can feel clunky by modern standards.\nFear Gauge Cult Classic #The “fear gauge” system is unique: instead of a traditional health bar, characters’ stress levels affect survivability, adding tension to encounters. Although this may sound like an unique mechanic, in reality, it works similar to traditional ones that serve the same purpose. While its visuals and atmosphere were praised, the game was criticized for stiff controls and sometimes frustrating difficulty. Overall, this title is a cult classic, more about mood, story, and style than smooth gameplay. This is a must-play for fans of the survival horror genre, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind retro games and can endure some outdated mechanics.\nCutscene-Heavy Retro Experience #Despite it being a very short title, it had a lot of discs for the PlayStation, in order to experience the whole game, I figure this should be because of the amount of cutscenes. My biggest complain about this title is the amount of scripted sequences, fortunately, I played using an emulator, so I could abuse the save state feature. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend playing this in the original platforms, it would not be a good experience. A standout for me is the amount of playable characters, and how their stories are linked, this makes the game much more dynamic compared to others of the same genre. This is a very unique game, not just for it\u0026rsquo;s genre, but overall, I highly recommend not skipping this one.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-effect/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stylish action-adventure game that is best remembered for its striking cel-shaded visual style.","title":"Fear Effect"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nFoundations of Perfect Dark #The first Perfect Dark entry is a landmark first-person shooter from Rare that expanded on the foundations laid by GoldenEye 007, delivering a rich, futuristic world full of intrigue, espionage, and alien conspiracies. The MC is called Joanna Dark, an elite operative working for the Carrington Institute, navigating missions that range from high-stakes infiltration to all-out firefights. The single-player campaign is impressively varied, offering objectives that go beyond simple “shoot everything” gameplay, including stealth sections, hostage rescues, data retrieval, and sabotage missions. This may not sound like much, but despite 007 showing how flexible shooters can be, this one also showed how original this genre can become.\nInventive Levels and Weapons #Each level is meticulously designed, with multiple paths and hidden areas encouraging exploration and creative problem-solving. The game’s weaponry is inventive, featuring guns with secondary fire modes, grenades, and sci-fi gadgets, giving players flexibility in combat and making encounters feel dynamic. The AI provides engaging challenges, particularly on higher difficulties where enemies are more alert and cooperative. The narrative, though not as deep as modern games, is compelling, with memorable characters, cinematic cutscenes, and a sense of urgency that drives you forward.\nMissing Multiplayer Impressions #Unfortunately I never got to experience the multiplayer, so I have nothing to say about this, but I know this was highly praised at the time, similar to the 007 title of the same platform. Graphically, this game pushed the Nintendo 64 hardware to its limits, with detailed environments, lighting effects, and fluid character animations that stood out in 2000. While the controls can feel a bit stiff by today’s standards, the game’s precision aiming and movement mechanics were revolutionary for the console era.\nA Timeless N64 Classic #In summary, this very unique shooter is a masterful blend of storytelling and innovative gameplay. It remains a classic of the N64 library, showcasing Rare’s creativity and ambition while influencing future generations of first-person shooters. Its mix of espionage, action, and sci-fi elements ensures it still holds a special place in the gaming history. This is definitely one of the best shooters of all time, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent, play it any way you can. Which unfortunately is a hard thing nowadays since we never got to see any re-release for modern platforms.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/perfect-dark/","section":"Posts","summary":"A landmark FPS that expanded on the foundations laid by GoldenEye 007, in a world full of intrigue and espionage.","title":"Perfect Dark"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRetro Horror Excellence #This title is an indie survival horror game developed by the two-person German studio rose-engine. It skillfully blends retro aesthetics with modern storytelling, evoking the classic survival horror titles of the late \u0026rsquo;90s and early 2000s, drawing comparisons to Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The MS is called Elster, a combat-trained android searching for her missing partner, Ariane, on a desolate planet. The story unfolds in a fragmented, dreamlike way, exploring themes of identity, memory, and existential dread. Its psychological depth and emotional resonance have been widely praised, I dare to say it has the same level of quality as big franchises such as Silent Hill.\nTense Strategic Gameplay #Gameplay features a top-down 2.5D perspective with fixed camera angles, limited inventory management, and intricate puzzles. Combat is deliberate and resource-constrained, heightening tension and requiring strategic thinking. While some aspects, like aiming and boss fight design, have minor flaws, they do not significantly impact the overall experience. In fact, I think the somewhat clunky nature of them are actually a feature, since it makes everything much more realistic when it comes to the protagonist mental state while dealing with the nightmarish situation she is in.\nPS1-Style Atmosphere #Visually, Signalis draws inspiration from early PlayStation-era games, with a distinctive art style complemented by a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack that enhances immersion. The game received generally favorable reviews, earning praise for its atmosphere and environmental storytelling. It was included in Polygon\u0026rsquo;s list of the best games of 2022 and recognized as the best horror game of 2022 by several outlets. A standout for me is the level of replayability, which is not something new to the frachise, but the way this was implemented into the game\u0026rsquo;s narrative is one of the most creative things I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced in any game.\nA Must-Play Horror #I highly encourage trying to 100% this game, since this feels like the intended way of playing it, not just because of the challenge and the completionist status, but mainly because of it\u0026rsquo;s story. You\u0026rsquo;ll only get to experience everything it is trying to convey if you dig deep into the alternative endings and optional content, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be a blast of an experience. Overall, Signalis is highly recommended for fans of psychological and retro survival horror, offering a compelling narrative, immersive design, and thoughtful gameplay that make it a standout experience. This is definitely one of the best survival horror games of all time, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/signalis/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is an indie survival horror game developed by the two-person German studio rose-engine.","title":"Signalis"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Defining Adventure #This title is often celebrated as one of the most influential action-adventure games ever made, and for good reason. It took the top-down formula of the original Zelda on the NES and refined it into something richer, more polished, and much more expansive. The MC is yet again Link, as he sets out to rescue Zelda and ultimately save Hyrule from the dark sorcerer Agahnim and the looming threat of Ganon. While the narrative is simple by today’s standards, at the time it felt grand, and the game’s atmosphere, enhanced by its music and world design, gave the journey a sense of epic scale.\nRevolutionary Dual Worlds #I remember the first time playing this back in the day, and feeling that this was the most unique game that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, it is funny because nowadays, most videogames use a lot of elements that this one introduced, so we take them for granted. One of the most groundbreaking features is the dual-world mechanic. The Light World and Dark World mirror each other but contain different geography, puzzles, and secrets. This system forces you to think creatively, switching between worlds to solve problems and unlock hidden areas. It was a clever design choice that expanded exploration and gave players a deeper sense of discovery.\nTimeless Gameplay Design #I had a similar feeling while playing SOTN, with the Inverted Castle feature. Gameplay-wise, this game shines with tight controls, engaging combat, and a steady flow of new items that keep the experience fresh. Tools like the Hookshot, Pegasus Boots, and the Master Sword became series staples, and the dungeon design balances combat, puzzles, and navigation in a way that still feels satisfying today. Each dungeon feels unique, and the bosses are memorable challenges that reward strategy rather than brute force. One title inspired by this is the first Alundra entry in the PlayStation 1, practically a 1-1 game but in the Sony platform, using absolutely all the elements of this Nintendo game.\nCharming 16-Bit Presentation #The presentation also deserves praise. The colorful 16-bit visuals remain charming, with detailed sprites and environments that bring Hyrule to life. The soundtrack is iconic, introducing themes that would go on to define the series for decades. What makes the game endure, though, is how it captures the spirit of adventure. There’s always something new to discover, hidden heart pieces, secret caves, and clever puzzles scattered across the world. It never feels bloated or overwhelming, but instead strikes a perfect balance between guided progression and rewarding curiosity.\nA Lasting Masterpiece #Even over 30 years later, A Link to the Past remains one of the high points of the Zelda franchise. Its design laid the foundation for future classics like Ocarina of Time while still standing tall as a timeless experience in its own right. This is one of the biggest masterpieces in gaming history, and a must-play for everybody. I also encourage diving into the ROM hacks scene, it is one of the most modded retro games of all time, similar to what happened with Super Mario World in the same platform. A lot of them look like very good alternative experiences.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is often celebrated as one of the most influential action-adventure games ever made, and for good reason.","title":"The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 22 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nMystery Fox Adventure #This title is an indie action-adventure game where you take control of a small, anthropomorphic fox who finds themselves in a vast and mysterious world filled with hidden secrets, dangerous enemies, and intricate puzzles. The game draws clear inspiration from classic adventure games, particularly The Legend of Zelda, blending exploration, combat, and discovery into a cohesive and rewarding experience. From the moment you step into the world of Tunic, there is a sense of curiosity and wonder, encouraging you to explore every nook and cranny.\nNon-Linear Discovery Depth #Exploration is central to the experience, with the game offering a non-linear world where secrets are tucked away in obscure corners. You collect pages of an in-game manual, written in a cryptic language, that provide subtle hints, maps, and guidance on how to progress. This system reinforces the feeling of discovery and rewards careful observation, creating an experience that is both challenging and deeply satisfying. Every encounter, puzzle, and hidden item feels meaningful, giving players a strong incentive to thoroughly investigate their surroundings.\nStrategic Stamina Combat #Combat is deliberately paced and strategic, relying on a mix of attacks, magic, and dodging. The game features a stamina system, which forces you to plan their actions carefully, and respawning enemies that maintain a sense of tension throughout the journey. Boss battles are memorable and often require learning patterns and timing, making victories feel earned. For people seeking a more accessible experience, the game includes a \u0026ldquo;No Fail Mode,\u0026rdquo; allowing for exploration without the pressure of punishing combat.\nWatercolor World Aesthetic #The visual design of Tunic is striking, with a soft, watercolor-inspired aesthetic that evokes both nostalgia and a sense of wonder. The world feels alive through its careful attention to detail, vibrant colors, and charming environmental design. The soundtrack enhances this atmosphere with an ethereal and immersive score that perfectly complements the game’s tone. Sound effects, subtle ambient noises, and the musical cues during exploration all contribute to a deeply engaging sensory experience.\nCritical Praise Overview #Critically, Tunic was well-received, earning praise for its inventive gameplay, sense of discovery, and beautiful presentation. Some criticisms were directed at the occasional clunkiness of combat and movement, as well as the steep difficulty curve that might frustrate some players. However, these issues are often outweighed by the game’s charm, rewarding exploration, and the satisfaction of uncovering its many secrets.\nNostalgic Innovative Journey #Overall, Tunic is a beautifully crafted and thoughtfully designed game that appeals to players who enjoy exploration, challenge, and discovery. Its combination of charming visuals, immersive soundtrack, cryptic puzzles, and strategic combat creates an experience that is both nostalgic and innovative. This is one of the best action-adventure games in gaming history a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.\nHidden Meta-Game Secrets #I also recommend playing it\u0026rsquo;s optional content, which is considered o be a whole meta-game behind it, with very well hidden secrets, like the Golden Path meta-game, which starts at the very beginning of the game, and you need to keep track of it until the very end. Not to mention the unique dialog/language which the community tried to translate to english in order to reveal it\u0026rsquo;s secrets. So if you are into these kind of thing, this is, surprisingly, one of the best titles out there.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/tunic/","section":"Posts","summary":"An indie action-adventure that you control of a small fox in a vast and mysterious world filled with hidden secrets.","title":"Tunic"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nAnalog Control Innovation #The 1st Ape Escape entry is a groundbreaking platformer that remains memorable for its unique gameplay and inventive use of the DualShock controller. As the first game to require analog sticks, it fully leverages the left stick for movement and the right stick for controlling a variety of gadgets, creating a control scheme that was revolutionary at the time. I remember having a hard time learning how to use both analog sticks in the PlayStation 2 era, and I never played Ape Escape back in the day, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad I played it very late so I was already used to the dual-analog sticks.\nPlayful Time-Travel Platforming #The MC is called Spike, tasked with capturing mischievous monkeys who have escaped through time using a range of creative tools, from nets to stun gadgets. The game shines with its colorful and imaginative level design, each area filled with puzzles, hidden collectibles, and secret monkeys to catch, encouraging exploration and replayability. Its whimsical sense of humor, quirky characters, and playful animations give it a lighthearted charm that appeals to both younger and older audiences.\nPioneering PlayStation Classic #While the camera can occasionally be tricky and some levels demand patience, the innovative controls and inventive gameplay make up for these minor flaws. Ape Escape isn’t just a fun platformer, it’s a technical showcase and a pioneer in demonstrating how analog controls could redefine player interaction.

The MC is called Ryu, a boy with the mysterious power to transform into a dragon, and his companions as they set out on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and survival in a world that doesn’t always welcome them. The narrative has a steady balance of lighthearted moments, often carried by quirky characters like Rei and Nina, and darker, more mature themes surrounding identity, loss, and the burden of power.\nHybrid Visuals Dragon Genes #Visually, the game stood out at the time by combining beautifully animated 2D sprites with polygonal 3D backgrounds, giving it a distinctive hybrid style. The combat is traditional turn-based, but the Dragon Gene system adds a creative layer of strategy: you can combine different genes to transform Ryu into a wide variety of dragons, each with unique strengths. This is by far the most unique mechanic, despite it being a common feature, this entry has the most depth to it.\nMasters Music Transformation #Not to mention you get double the amount of dragon designs since you play as child and adult versions of Ryu, so you get double the amount of dragon transformation designs. The Master System also deepens character customization, letting you shape their party’s abilities through mentorships, which was innovative for its time. The soundtrack blends jazz influences with emotional melodies, perfectly capturing both the adventurous and somber tones of the story.\nAged Yet Memorable #However, like many JRPGs of the late ’90s, the game does show its age, random encounters can feel too frequent, some sections drag in pacing, and the difficulty curve can be uneven. Despite these flaws, this videogame remains one of the most memorable entries in the series. Its heartfelt story, unique mechanics, and strong atmosphere have earned it a dedicated fanbase, and it’s often remembered as the high point of Capcom’s foray into traditional RPGs.\n","date":"30 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/breath-of-fire-iii/","section":"Posts","summary":"The 3rd Breath of Fire entry is a beloved JRPG from Capcom that represents both the charm and challenges of its era.","title":"Breath of Fire III"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nGBA Metroidvania Foundations #This Castlevania GBA entry was one of the very first games available on the GBA, and it made a strong impression despite its quirks. The MC is called Nathan Graves as he ventures into Dracula’s castle to rescue his mentor, offering a blend of classic side-scrolling action and the exploratory metroidvania design that Symphony of the Night popularized. And honestly, most the Castlevania titles, released after SOTN, was intended to be metroidvanias due to the insane popularity of this PlayStation 1 entry.\nDSS Depth Challenge #The game’s most unique addition is the Dual Set-Up System (DSS), which lets players combine two sets of magic cards dropped by enemies to unlock a wide variety of abilities, ranging from elemental attacks to stat boosts. This mechanic adds depth and replayability, since different card combos can completely change how you approach combat. A standout for me is the optional content, the Battle Arena is a coliseum-like which has a lot of combat challenges, I highly recommend playing it, but only when you are late into the game because it is very hard.\nPunishing Gothic Classic #Its difficulty is also steeper than later handheld Castlevania titles, with tougher enemies, stricter controls, and limited healing opportunities. Despite these flaws, this title is remembered as a strong and atmospheric entry in the franchise. It set the stage for future GBA Castlevanias and showed off the handheld’s potential right at launch. For fans of challenging action-adventure games with a Gothic vibe, it remains a rewarding, if sometimes punishing, experience.

The MC continues to be Kratos, once the rage-driven Spartan warrior, is now portrayed as a more complex character, struggling with fatherhood and his violent past while guiding his young son, Atreus, on a perilous journey. The storytelling is one of the game’s strongest points. It seamlessly blends large-scale mythological encounters with intimate, emotional moments. The single-camera perspective, where the entire game plays out without visible cuts, keeps you immersed in both action and narrative, making every scene feel personal and immediate.\nKratos and Atreus\u0026rsquo; Bond #Kratos’s relationship with Atreus grows naturally as the game progresses, giving weight to their journey beyond just combat. Playing this feels like playing something like The Last of Us, the dynamic between the two characters is very similar. On the gameplay side, combat is brutal, satisfying, and layered. The Leviathan Axe, with its recall mechanic, feels incredibly impactful and is versatile in both melee and ranged encounters. As you progress, upgrades and new abilities add depth, allowing for varied strategies against different enemy types.\nMetroidvania Elements \u0026amp; Combat #You can even feel light metroidvania elements since most of the maps are linked, and have a hub area that you can come back to, in order to explore more, or to find new paths. The mix of heavy, deliberate strikes with responsive dodging and parrying creates a combat system that feels both methodical and rewarding. The art direction already shines with breathtaking landscapes, detailed character models, and dynamic lighting, but the technical enhancements make it feel like a current-generation title. Exploration leans toward a semi-open design.\nSemi-Open World Exploration #While not fully open-world, the game features hubs and side paths that reward curiosity with lore, puzzles, and optional boss fights. These side activities add depth without overwhelming you, though those seeking true open-world freedom may find the structure a bit constrained. If there’s a criticism, it’s that the pacing can feel deliberate, especially early on, with tutorials and narrative buildup taking center stage before combat fully opens up. Some backtracking also occurs later in the game, which may not appeal to everyone. However, these are minor compared to the overall polish and narrative depth.\nPacing and Structure Critique #A standout for me are the optional content with very difficult combat sequences, similar to previous titles of the franchise. But this time, it has been escalated to insanity in comparison, being one of the most difficult combat sequences that I\u0026rsquo;ve played on a Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash videogame. Overall, it is both a technical triumph and a storytelling landmark. It successfully reinvents the series while staying true to its roots in visceral action. With its emotional narrative, refined combat. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys cinematic single-player adventures, and there is no excuse for fans of the franchise not to play this, despite it being very different from the previous entries.\n","date":"30 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/god-of-war-2018/","section":"Posts","summary":"This God of War franchise entry tells a deeply personal yet grand tale set within Norse mythology.","title":"God of War (2018)"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nWorld Restoration Journey #This title is a standout action-RPG that remains a hidden gem of the original PlayStation era.

As you progress, you witness continents, civilizations, and nature itself being restored, giving the game a sense of scale and purpose rarely seen in RPGs of its time. It has a similar vibe to the title called Soul Blazer, sharing a lot of similarities, not just when it comes to their narratives.\nAction-RPG Narrative Depth #Gameplay in Terranigma blends fast-paced, real-time combat with exploration and puzzle-solving. Dungeons are cleverly designed, and towns feel alive, each with their own unique characters and stories. The controls are tight, and the progression system balances character growth with equipment upgrades and abilities. One of the game’s most impressive aspects is its narrative: it evolves from a simple adventure into a deep meditation on life, death, human ambition, and the consequences of one’s actions.\nMemorable Art Soundtrack #Emotional moments are surprisingly frequent, and certain story beats are still remembered as some of the most touching in 16/32-bit-era RPGs. Visually, Terranigma uses colorful, detailed sprite work and vibrant environments, creating a world that feels both whimsical and expansive. The soundtrack ranges from energetic battle themes to hauntingly beautiful melodies that enhance both exploration and story-driven moments.\nOverlooked JRPG Masterpiece #Although it was never officially released in North America, the game has gained a devoted fanbase over the years, praised for its originality, depth, and emotional resonance. For anyone interested in classic RPGs, Terranigma is more than just a game, it’s an experience that lingers long after the console is turned off.

Traversing the rooftops and alleyways of Harran feels fluid and exhilarating, giving you a unique sense of freedom compared to most games in the genre. The day and night cycle is one of its strongest features, dramatically shifting the tone of the game. During the day, players can scavenge and fight with relative safety, but when night falls, the city becomes terrifying as more aggressive and deadly infected emerge, creating tense survival scenarios.\nEngaging Loop, Weak Story #The core gameplay loop combines melee combat, scavenging, and crafting, which keeps survival engaging and resource-driven. Visuals and atmosphere were impressive for the time, with detailed environments and lighting effects that enhanced immersion. However, the game isn’t without flaws. Side missions often become repetitive, mostly revolving around simple fetch quests or clearing areas. The story, while serviceable, leans heavily on familiar zombie tropes and doesn’t leave a strong narrative impact.\nMemorable Survival Action #Despite its shortcomings, Dying Light delivers a rewarding experience for fans of survival and action games. Its blend of parkour, brutal combat, and the fear-inducing night cycle makes it one of the more memorable entries in the zombie genre.

The level of detail in the world design, from bustling streets to sprawling slums, showcases the capabilities of modern PC hardware, delivering an immersive visual experience for both longtime fans and newcomers.\nHybrid Combat Evolution #The combat system is a notable departure from the original turn-based mechanics, combining real-time action with tactical elements. You can switch between party members on the fly, use abilities strategically via the ATB system, and execute cinematic Limit Breaks. This hybrid approach allows for both fast-paced combat and careful planning, making encounters satisfying and engaging. While many praise this evolution, some fans of the original’s classic turn-based style may find the new system initially challenging to adapt to.\nExpanded Narrative Depth #Though this will only be an issue if you not familiar in any way to action games in general, which is very rare not to be familiar with nowadays. Narratively, the remake expands on the story of Cloud, Aerith, and the rest of the team, giving side characters more depth and introducing new plot threads. This added content enriches the storytelling and emotional impact, although it can alter the pacing compared to the original. For those who appreciate character-driven narratives will likely enjoy these expansions, while some purists may find certain deviations from the source material unexpected.\nMusic and Performances #The OST, which blends reimagined classics with new compositions, is another highlight, complementing the emotional weight and intensity of the story. Voice acting is strong across the cast, particularly for the main characters, adding another layer of immersion. This is a rare case which you can switch between the Japanese and the English dubs and you\u0026rsquo;ll have a good time on both experiences. In summary, this remake is a visually stunning and narratively rich reimagining that modernizes one of the most beloved RPGs of all time.\nAn Exceptional Remake #While it has minor technical issues and pacing adjustments, its innovative combat system, expanded story, and breathtaking presentation make it a must-play experience for both fans of the original and newcomers alike. FFVII was one of my first RPGs of all time, and I consider it to be one of the best video-games ever made, so I was shocked when this remake was announced. Amazing that they were able to completely destroy my expectations in a good way, this is definitely one of the best remakes the gaming industry has ever experienced. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t sleep on the optional Yuffie content, it is one of the best optional content I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced.\n","date":"29 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/final-fantasy-vii-remake/","section":"Posts","summary":"A masterful reimagining of the beloved 1997 classic, blending nostalgia with modern gameplay innovations.","title":"Final Fantasy VII Remake"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 17 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCharming Visuals and Atmosphere #This title is a charming puzzle-platformer that stands out for its hand-painted, storybook-like visuals.

Instead, it should have a clear sing-posting of what to do next, in order for the player to focus solely in the platforming and puzzle-solving.

The game constantly sings your actions, commentary, and jokes, turning the soundtrack into an interactive storytelling tool. This musical twist, paired with polished pixel art and a charming retro style, makes the game feel both nostalgic and fresh. This is a very important game for me since it is from Brazil, my homeland, and it is very unique and inspiring no only because of it\u0026rsquo;s unique narrative, but also because it was dubbed in both Portuguese and English.\nClassic Gameplay Foundations #The gameplay itself is rooted in classic platforming traditions, with varied biomes, hidden areas, and boss fights. For fans of old-school platformers, it captures the spirit of the genre while layering humor and personality on top. However, the very feature that sets it apart, the nonstop singing, can become repetitive or even grating for some players after extended sessions. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a very complex or challenging level design, but it is good enough for what it is trying to do, just don\u0026rsquo;t expect anything especial for the combat, platforming and exploration.\nQuirky Mechanics Appeal #Mechanically, the game is serviceable but not flawless, certain tools, like the hookshot, can feel clunky, and some level segments, such as mine-cart or asteroid-style stages, lean more toward frustration than fun. Overall, the game is best suited for people who enjoy quirky ideas and appreciate humor mixed with classic platforming. Those seeking a perfectly tight platformer or who dislike gimmick-heavy design may find it less appealing, but for others, it offers a creative and lighthearted adventure with a memorable twist.\n","date":"29 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/song-for-a-hero/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a 2D platformer developed by Dumativa that stands out for its unique presentation.","title":"Song for a Hero"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 4 hours ⭐ (1/5)\nUninspired Vampire Narrative #This title is a hack-and-slash action RPG that combines vampire lore with fast-paced combat and cooperative gameplay. The MCs are Jeremy, a vampire hunter turned into what he despises, and Alysa, a vampire warrior forced to fight alongside him. Their uneasy alliance drives the narrative, though the plot and dialogue are often criticized for being predictable and lacking depth. The characters are not very charismatic, this is one of the biggest downsides in my opinion, because there are a lot of dialogs on this game.\nRepetitive Co-op Combat #The gameplay centers on melee and ranged combat, with Jeremy wielding swords and Alysa using crossbows. You can switch between the two characters or play in local co-op, which adds variety. However, the combat tends to feel repetitive, with limited enemy types and simplistic mechanics that don’t evolve much as the game progresses. I really tried to like this one but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to beat it, it is not very balanced for playing alone, which is how I choose to go, so my advise is to only try this one out if you have a friend to join in.\nRough Budget Experience #Visually, this game shows its budget, with dated graphics and stiff animations, though its gothic-inspired environments still carry some atmosphere. The game also suffers from technical rough edges, including awkward controls and occasional bugs.

The combat is clumsy and frustrating right from the start, with sluggish controls and awkward mechanics that make even simple encounters feel like a struggle. Instead of learning curves or rewarding fights, the game delivers battles that feel more like a test of patience than skill.\nFlat Storytelling Delivery #The story, while hinting at an interesting conflict between humanity and demonic influence, doesn’t manage to grab attention early on. The dialogue feels flat, and the characters come across as uninteresting, making it difficult to care about what’s happening. The voice acting and stiff presentation only add to the sense that the world lacks energy or personality.\nUnfulfilled RPG Potential #After a few hours, it becomes clear that the rough combat, uninspired storytelling, and dull pacing overshadow any potential the game might have had.

The opening felt slow and unnecessarily clunky, with systems that seemed more complicated than fun. Where the original struck a nice balance of survival mechanics and action, this sequel felt bogged down by tedious base-building and grindy resource management.\nLost Atmosphere Charm #The atmosphere also didn’t grab me the way the first game did. The environments looked bland and repetitive, and the charm of the original’s tone was missing. Even though I enjoyed crafting and scavenging before, here it felt like busywork rather than something rewarding. Playing solo especially made the whole experience feel flat, and the lack of a compelling story didn’t help.\nDisappointing Sequel Direction #For me, the first game was a pleasant surprise, but this one turned into a disappointment. Instead of improving on what worked, it added layers that made the experience less enjoyable. I couldn’t find the motivation to push further, and it left me wishing I had just replayed the original instead.

Determined to reclaim his throne, Evan embarks on a journey to build a new kingdom where everyone can live in harmony. Along the way, players meet a cast of quirky companions, each bringing their own charm and abilities to the adventure.\nGhibli-Inspired World Design #The game’s world is visually striking, with environments and character designs clearly influenced by Studio Ghibli’s signature style. The landscapes are lush, the cities vibrant, and the attention to detail in every corner of the world helps create an immersive experience. The real-time combat system adds a dynamic element to battles, allowing you to switch between party members and employ strategic use of abilities. Additionally, the kingdom management mechanics provide a welcome layer of depth, letting you construct buildings, recruit citizens, and expand their influence across the world.\nDivisive Management Mechanics #Particularly speaking I really hate management mechanics such as the ones on this game, so I can\u0026rsquo;t really give an in-depth opinion, but I can assure you that if you also don\u0026rsquo;t like this kind of thing, this title won\u0026rsquo;t win you over. Fortunately this is just but one of this game\u0026rsquo;s aspects, and you can easily overlook this since almost all the other mechanics are very well implemented, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother much about this. The soundtrack complements the game beautifully, enhancing both the emotional weight of the story and the sense of wonder during exploration.\nGenre-Driven Shortcomings #Despite these strengths, the game does have some drawbacks. The story pacing can feel uneven at times, and certain character arcs lack the depth seen in the first Ni no Kuni. Some people may find the dialogue and quest structure overly simplistic, and the combat, while engaging, can occasionally become repetitive during longer play sessions. But all these problems are really more related to the JRPG genre than anything else, the only particular issue in my opinion is that this title really tries to make compelling and charismatic characters, but it fails more often than not.\nA Worthy JRPG Journey #Overall, this title manages to deliver a charming and magical RPG experience. Its combination of striking visuals, a heartfelt story, engaging combat, and kingdom-building mechanics makes it a memorable journey, even if it doesn’t fully reach the emotional heights of the original. For fans of JRPGs and anyone looking for a visually captivating adventure, it remains a title worth exploring. I would say this is a must-play for fans of the JRPG genre, it is high up there along with the classics.\n","date":"26 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ni-no-kuni-ii-revenant-kingdom/","section":"Posts","summary":"A colorful and ambitious action JRPG that aims to capture the magic of its predecessor.","title":"Ni no Kuni II Revenant Kingdom"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 1 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nDerivative First Hours #If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the first few hours of second entry to The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing franchise, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Many people found the game\u0026rsquo;s introduction to be a stumbling block. Gameplay-wise, the early hours introduced mechanics that felt derivative of other action RPGs, such as Diablo III. While the combat system was functional, it didn\u0026rsquo;t offer enough innovation to captivate you into seeking a fresh experience.\nSlow, Uninspiring Start #The game\u0026rsquo;s reliance on familiar tropes without adding unique twists may have contributed to the initial disengagement. Additionally, the game\u0026rsquo;s pacing and progression system were slow to unfold. Without a compelling hook in the early stages. In summary, this game is presented a challenging start that may have deterred people from continuing.

It combines twin-stick shooting with platforming in a sci-fi setting, where you control Eliosi, a young alien aspiring to become a bounty hunter. The game offers five main stages with distinct environments, bosses, and collectibles, and it encourages replayability through speedrunning challenges, hidden items, and branching paths.\nVisuals and Challenge #The strongest points are its visuals and atmosphere, which feel polished and ambitious for a debut indie title. Environments look alien and varied, with good lighting and effects. The game also provides a high level of challenge that can be rewarding who enjoy precise movement and tough encounters. Its design encourages mastery, with mechanics like destroying checkpoints for faster runs adding depth.\nDifficulty and Length Issues #On the downside, the difficulty can feel punishing, often due to imprecise platforming, confusing visuals, or overwhelming enemy encounters. Some boss fights and sections come across as unfair rather than just hard. The campaign is short, with only five levels, so while there is replay value, so if you are looking for a longer experience the you may find it limited.\nFinal Verdict #Overall, this is is a visually appealing game, ambitious, and tough action platformer that will appeal most to fans of old-school, skill-based games who don’t mind frequent retries. For people who prefer a smoother difficulty curve or a longer narrative experience, it may be frustrating or feel too brief.

The factions, Knights, Vikings, and Samurai, are brought to life with distinct playstyles and strong visual design, which adds variety and personality to the battlefield.\nTechnical and Progression Issues #I honestly couldn\u0026rsquo;t get into this title due to the lack of servers here in South America, but the very few matches that I managed to play showed me the potential this game has. At launch, technical issues like peer-to-peer networking and connection problems also frustrated a lot of people, including myself, as already mentioned. And the progression system felt grind-heavy with its reliance on in-game currency and microtransactions, which is a common plague of this company\u0026rsquo;s games nowadays.\nA Unique Multiplayer Niche #Despite its flaws, For Honor delivers an intense and strategic multiplayer experience that rewards patience and skill. For people who value competitive melee combat, it offers something distinct and memorable, even if it demands time and persistence to fully enjoy.

From the very beginning, the game captures attention with its hand-painted art style, rich color palette, and fluid animations, creating an enchanting forest that feels alive. Accompanied by a deeply moving orchestral score, the presentation alone sets a high standard for immersion and atmosphere.\nEmotion Through Silence #The MC is called Ori, a small guardian spirit, and Sein, the “light and eyes” of the Spirit Tree, on a journey to restore balance to a forest consumed by decay. Themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and hope drive the narrative, and the opening sequence in particular is both heart-wrenching and memorable, immediately establishing an emotional connection to the world and its characters. It is impressive how the story is able to convey so many things even though it has very little dialog sequences.\nPrecision Platforming Focus #Gameplay focuses heavily on precision platforming, with Ori gradually acquiring new abilities that expand traversal options, from wall climbing and double jumps to the ingenious “bash” mechanic that lets you ricochet off enemies and projectiles. These upgrades not only add variety but also encourage exploration, as hidden secrets and upgrades are scattered throughout the interconnected map. Escape sequences replace traditional boss fights, delivering fast-paced challenges where survival depends on flawless execution.\nMovement Over Combat #Combat, while secondary to movement, is simple yet effective, relying on spirit flame attacks and clever use of Ori’s mobility. Though compared to other games of the similar genre, the combat is very limited and not really the main point. The game can be unforgiving, with tricky jumps and punishing sequences that may require multiple retries, but its manual save system provides flexibility for you to set your own checkpoints.\nArtistry and Challenge #Ultimately, this title stands out as more than just a metroidvania platformer. It’s a heartfelt experience that marries artistry with challenge, rewarding perseverance with moments of pure wonder. For people who appreciate beautiful design and demanding yet fair gameplay, it remains one of the most memorable indie titles of its generation.

Each heist can be approached in multiple ways, whether opting for stealth to avoid alarms or going in guns blazing, which adds a layer of tactical depth. One of the game’s standout features is its extensive customization system, built upon it\u0026rsquo;s amazing community.

This technological setting is perfect for the Soulslike formula, and I\u0026rsquo;m surprised we don\u0026rsquo;t have more titles similar to this one.\nTactical Limb Combat #The biggest strength of the game lies in its combat system.

This makes up for the lack of elements such as magic, since it\u0026rsquo;s setting wouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow for this to make any sense, and it add some much needed dept to the viable playstyles.

The narrative starts with promise but fails to maintain momentum, offering little in terms of memorable characters or storytelling. Technical issues like awkward camera angles and inconsistent hit detection can also break immersion, not to mention the weird movement and feeling of impact, compared to other titles of the similar genre.\nStrong Yet Imperfect #Overall, this game is a challenging and rewarding experience for players who enjoy methodical, punishing combat in the style of Dark Souls. Its unique limb-targeting system and gritty atmosphere make it stand out, though its repetitive environments and weaker narrative prevent it from reaching the same heights as its inspirations.

Challenge tombs are a particular highlight, offering clever environmental puzzles that feel more rewarding and substantial than before. Combat and traversal are fluid, with stealth, climbing, and weapon variety blending smoothly into the action.\nMature Character Arc #Lara herself is portrayed as more mature and driven, with her character development adding weight to the story. While the narrative can lean on familiar tropes and predictable beats, it still provides memorable moments and a strong motivation for Lara’s journey. This reboot is a funny phenomenon, it inspired a lot of titles such as Sony\u0026rsquo;s Uncharted, and as time goes by, this reboot was actually inspired by Uncharted. And this is actually a nice thing since all these titles are very good in general.

So no big surprises on how the core of this game works, if you played and enjoyed the two previous entries, there is little to no excuse not to play this one.\nProblematic 3D Shift #However, the shift from 2.5D to full 3D comes with drawbacks, depth perception and camera angles can make platforming and puzzles frustrating, and the precision of movement feels less refined than in earlier entries. I was particularly hyped to play this once I saw the change of perspective, but unfortunately this first attempt of transitioning was a very flawed one, compared to the more traditional and polished previous entries. Despite all this, if you are a fan of this franchise like myself, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to overlook these limitations and still enjoy this different way of playing this.\nAmbitious but Flawed #The game is also noticeably short, with its story ending abruptly and leaving the impression of an incomplete experience. On top of that, progression systems and character abilities are simplified compared to Trine 2, which reduces depth and replay value.

Fans of the series may still enjoy the ride, but expectations should be tempered.\n","date":"24 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/trine-3-the-artifacts-of-power/","section":"Posts","summary":"A visually stunning game, carrying forward the series\u0026rsquo; trademark fairy-tale charm.","title":"Trine 3 The Artifacts of Power"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 17 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nStory-Driven Reboot #This Wolfenstein etry in the franchise delivers a compelling alternate-history story where the Nazis have won World War II. The MC is called B.J. Blazkowicz and his fight with the resistance, offering well-developed characters and emotional moments that give the campaign real weight. And this is a first in the series, which is a very oldschool shooter one, and most, if not all of them, back in the day, had zero to no focus in the characters and the story behind them.\nPower-Fantasy Combat #The gameplay is satisfying, blending fast-paced gunfights with optional stealth mechanics. Combat is versatile, allowing different approaches, and the progression system rewards varied playstyles. The level design encourages exploration, and the campaign length is substantial for a single-player shooter. Although particularly speaking, most people, including myself, will choose the \u0026ldquo;guns blazing\u0026rdquo; approach, since a lot of the marketing behind this title had this as a focus, and it is a very satisfying approach, this game really makes you feel like a power-phantasy shooter.\nPresentation and Tone #Graphically, the game was impressive for its time, with detailed environments, smooth animations, and solid sound design that enhances immersion. Voice acting and music further strengthen the atmosphere, making the story and action feel more engaging. Some issues arise with inconsistent tone, as the game shifts between serious storytelling and over-the-top action, which can feel jarring.\nStrong Modernization #Enemy AI and stealth mechanics have limitations, occasionally breaking immersion. Overall, it successfully modernizes the classic Wolfenstein formula, combining strong storytelling, satisfying combat, and high production values, making it a standout single-player FPS of its era. I highly recommend this game to anybody who likes shooters to any extent, it is a really amazing reboot to the franchise. And it is especially amazing for fans of the old titles since it has a lot of references, and even some secrets for you to enjoy.\n","date":"24 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/wolfenstein-the-new-order/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Wolfenstein entry in the franchise delivers a compelling alternate-history story where the Nazis have won World War II.","title":"Wolfenstein The New Order"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 32 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNostalgic Platforming Roots #The first Yooka-Laylee entry is a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, created by former Rare developers, and it clearly aims to revive the late-’90s 3D platformer formula. The game succeeds in delivering a colorful, charming world full of quirky characters, lighthearted humor, and a nostalgic collectathon experience. Its bright visuals, varied level designs, and catchy soundtrack capture much of the playful atmosphere that fans of the genre love. And although I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of collectathons, particularly I prefer regular 3D platformers, I still play some of these, from time to time.\nContent Rich, Flawed Design #There’s also a lot of content to explore, with expansive worlds and plenty of hidden items if you enjoy hunting for secrets. However, the game also inherits many of the flaws of its inspirations. The camera and controls are often frustrating, making platforming less precise than it should be. Navigation can feel clunky due to confusing level layouts and the lack of helpful tools like a map, which turns exploration into wandering at times. And this is very unfortunately since this was supposed to be a modernized version of the classics of the same genre, all these elements should have been improved.\nCharm Versus Frustration #Some challenges and boss encounters feel dated or poorly balanced, showing rough edges in design and pacing. While the game’s retro charm appeals to nostalgic people, modern audiences may find these issues more irritating than endearing. Overall, this title delivers on its promise of reviving the classic 3D platformer, but it does so with a mix of charm and frustration. For those who grew up with games like Banjo-Kazooie, it’s a heartfelt throwback worth experiencing despite its flaws. For those expecting a polished, modern platformer, however, the game may feel too dated and uneven.\n","date":"24 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/yooka-laylee/","section":"Posts","summary":"A spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, and it clearly aims to revive the late-’90s 3D platformer formula.","title":"Yooka-Laylee"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 33 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nRetro-Futuristic Terror #This Alien title is a first-person survival horror game set in the universe of Ridley Scott’s universe. It captures the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the 1979 film with incredible attention to detail, from the industrial corridors of the Sevastopol space station to the eerie lighting and sound design. The atmosphere is tense and oppressive, making every moment feel unsettling.\nThe Perfect Stalker #The Alien itself is the game’s standout feature. Its unpredictable AI ensures it constantly stalks the player, reacting to noise and movement in ways that keep encounters frightening and fresh. And eve to this day, this AI is very impressive, nothing really matches this, despite it being focused on horror titles, and for a stalker enemy, this is still an impressive technical marvel in the gaming industry as a whole.\nTension and Frustration #Hiding in lockers, holding your breath, and nervously watching the motion tracker create some of the most memorable and terrifying moments in modern horror gaming. However, the experience is not without flaws. The campaign can feel overly long, with sections that repeat similar fetch-quest mechanics and slow pacing that sometimes dilutes the tension. The manual save system can add to the stress, as death often forces you to replay long stretches.\nA Horror Classic #Despite these drawbacks, this game remains a standout horror title on PC. It offers a faithful and chilling adaptation of the Alien universe, rewarding patience and careful play with some of the most immersive scares the genre has to offer. It is definitely one of the best horror games of all time, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.\n","date":"23 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/alien-isolation/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Alien title is a first-person survival horror game set in the universe of Ridley Scott’s universe.","title":"Alien Isolation"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nClassic Ninja Revival #This videogame is a retro-inspired action platformer that successfully channels the spirit of classic 8-bit ninja games. Its pixel art style, energetic soundtrack, and fast-paced gameplay create an authentic old-school atmosphere that feels both nostalgic and polished. The controls are tight and responsive, making combat and platforming satisfying, while bosses stand out as memorable highlights with challenging patterns to master.\nPunishing Precision Challenge #The game is very very difficult, and while checkpoints help ease the frustration, some late-game sections can feel punishing with sudden difficulty spikes and tricky hazards. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to fail multiple times, and you dislike experiences such as the classic Ninja Gaiden titles, then I would stay away from this one, otherwise, this is one of the best modern representations of this idea. Core abilities like the double jump and dash unlock later than expected, which can make early areas feel somewhat restrictive.\nFocused, Rewarding Design #Exploration is present but limited, leaning more on linear progression than open-ended backtracking. Despite these drawbacks, this title is a strong recommendation for fans of tough, precise action platformers. It offers a rewarding challenge that pays homage to its inspirations while carving its own identity through sharp design and modern refinements. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of this kind of game, especially because they are short enough to make the 100% worth it, which is something I highly recommend doing, it is very satisfying and it feels like the intended way to experience this.\n","date":"23 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/cyber-shadow/","section":"Posts","summary":"A retro-inspired action platformer that successfully channels the spirit of classic 8-bit ninja games.","title":"Cyber Shadow"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 21 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nMythic Cooperative Hook #This title is a cooperative action RPG with a strong focus on myth-making and replayability. Its pixel art style and atmospheric soundtrack create a distinctive tribal fantasy world that feels both mystical and inviting. The game’s central hook is how your choices, whether in dialogue, exploration, or combat, shape the legend of your character, turning each run into a short, personalized myth.\nReplayability Through Cooperation #The game is designed for replay, with each run lasting under an hour and encouraging you to try new classes, tribes, and decisions to uncover different endings. Playing with friends adds a lot of charm, as the cooperative structure makes exploring the world and shaping the story together more engaging. This formula is perfect for playing with friends, and this title really feels like it was meant to be experienced this way, though unfortunately for me I played through it\u0026rsquo;s entirety completely alone, which I would not recommend doing.\nUnbalanced Solo Experience #Playing alone is definitely the worst way to experience this game, and not a very pleasant one, since the classes have a lot of synergy when played together, to the point where some classes, while playing solo, are not really viable if not played to absolute perfection. And this is very frustrating since there are so many amazing characters and classes to play around with, but playing alone really makes this experience a very unbalanced one.\nStyle Over Depth #The experience can feel shallow after a few playthroughs. Combat is simple and sometimes unbalanced, enemy variety is limited, and the procedurally generated areas repeat themselves quickly. While the narrative framing is clever, the short length and low complexity may leave you wanting more depth. Overall, this title succeeds as a stylish and imaginative indie RPG that values atmosphere and storytelling over mechanical complexity. It’s best enjoyed in short bursts or with friends, rather than as a long-term, content-rich adventure.\n","date":"23 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/moon-hunters/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a cooperative action RPG with a strong focus on myth-making and replayability.","title":"Moon Hunters"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Platforming Legacy #The 2011 PC release of Another World: 20th Anniversary Edition is a remastered version of Éric Chahi’s 1991 cinematic platformer.

The remaster features enhanced graphics, and a nice feature allows you to switch between the original and updated visuals, giving a fresh perspective on the game’s iconic art. The soundtrack and sound design remain impressive, effectively setting the tone and immersing players in the game’s world.\nHistoric Yet Clunky #As a pioneering title in cinematic platforming, Another World offers a glimpse into the evolution of video game design. However, its controls can feel clunky by modern standards, and the trial-and-error gameplay may frustrate some players. And this is a hard game to recommend to the average person, since it is a very niche genre, gameplay feel and overall vision of what a videogame can achieve in terms of narrative and story-telling.\nNiche Narrative Vision #It is especially more niche since this was one of the first games that had this implementation idea for narrative, but if you are into alternative games like this one, this is definitely a must-play, and a historical landmark in gaming history. The game’s high difficulty, with instant deaths and minimal guidance, can be challenging for newcomers, and its dated design may not appeal to everyone.\nPreserved Classic Appeal #Overall, this Another World (AKA: Out of This World) remaster is a visually enhanced re-release of a classic game that retains its original charm and challenge.

You explore a mysterious, open world to face 19 colossal titans, each requiring precision, strategy, and timing to defeat. The game’s combat is built around a single arrow mechanic, making every shot critical and each encounter tense and rewarding. Every boss fight feels like a unique puzzle, emphasizing pattern recognition, careful observation, and reflexes.\nHaunting Minimalist Atmosphere #The game’s 2D pixel art style and evocative soundtrack create a hauntingly atmospheric world, full of solitude and mystery. The environments are sparse but carefully designed, encouraging exploration while keeping the focus on the titans themselves. The minimalist approach extends to storytelling, which is deliberately understated, leaving much for you to interpret and imagine. And this is strong point if you like this kind of thing, as much as it is a downside if you don\u0026rsquo;t like this kind of alternative approach to story-telling.\nHigh Risk, Repetition #Despite its strengths, this title can feel repetitive over time due to its limited set of actions, shooting and dodging. The difficulty is deliberately high, with both the player and enemies able to be defeated in a single hit, which can lead to frustration for some. The lack of checkpoints adds tension but can also make progress feel punishing. I\u0026rsquo;d say this is a very niche and tailored game for people who enjoy difficult games, with limited protagonists, so no power-phantasy or making your character strong enough in order to make certain sections a breeze.\nSmall Against Giants #Instead, it really makes you feel as small as the character on-screen seems to be, especially when it comes to the massive boss encounters, this is where this game really achieves what it is trying to convey.

It throws away the slow, cover-based style of many modern shooters and instead forces you into aggressive, high-speed combat. Enemies never let up, and the game rewards you for staying on the move with health and ammo pickups gained through brutal “Glory Kills.” The gunplay feels fantastic, with each weapon having a distinct weight and impact, and upgrades give you plenty of ways to tweak your playstyle.\nClassic Design, Modern Polish #The campaign offers large, arena-like levels that encourage exploration for secrets and weapon mods, echoing the design of classic Doom but with modern polish. The visuals are sharp and detailed, and Mick Gordon’s heavy, industrial metal soundtrack perfectly complements the frantic action, often elevating fights into pure adrenaline rushes. The story is light, framing you as the unstoppable Doom Slayer rather than bogging you down with exposition.\nWeapon-Centric Progression #One of my favorite aspects of this entry is the attempt to bring some depth and complexity to the progression, adding weapon upgrades, attachments, mods and etc. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the game standout in any way compared to other games that has similar mechanics, but this is a first in the Doom franchise, which makes this special. At the same time, there is little to no progression when it comes to the main character itself, which is a bummer, making the weapons the protagonists, like they always were.\nGenre-Defining Shooter #Some arenas can feel a bit repetitive toward the end, but this is a trait of almost all single-player FPS games due to it\u0026rsquo;s lack of depth and complexity in most of it\u0026rsquo;s elements besides the combat. This reboot sets new standards for modern shooters, even creating a whole new genre which is heavily inspired by this entry, similar to what the original Doom did back in the day.

Its standout feature is the fast, weighty combat system, one of the most satisfying in the genre. Battles against towering beasts like chimeras and griffins feel epic, as you can grab onto their bodies, climb them, and strike at weak points, making each encounter dynamic and unpredictable.\nPawn System Depth #Another highlight is the Pawn system, where you create a customizable AI companion and recruit others made by real players through the entire world. This adds a sense of community and variety to party composition, even when playing offline, though honestly speaking I choose to play alone, offline, and only used my own pawns, customized by myself. The expansion content, Bitterblack Isle, introduces some of the game’s most challenging dungeons and enemies, greatly increasing replay value, and I got to admit that I was not able to finish this one, but I highly encourage grinding this one out of you are a fan, it is a very good experience, if you have the patience.\nFlexible Class Freedom #One of it\u0026rsquo;s best features in my opinion, and one that I played around with the most, is the class system. You can mix and match different class skills, creating very unique combos and playstyles. Particularly speaking I like to play melee close-combat characters, but I also like to play non-tank ones, so I went with a mix of the Fighter and the Rogue, which is called Assassin.

The game avoids traditional dialogue and instead builds its narrative through disturbing imagery, haunting sound design, and the oppressive environments you explore.\nInterpretative Stealth Puzzles #For those who like interpretative narratives, this is a very good title, it is good to engage with it\u0026rsquo;s community to try and find out what is actually happening in the game\u0026rsquo;s story, not that this is a must in order to enjoy the experience, but it is definitely a plus. The gameplay focuses on stealth, light platforming, and physics-based puzzles. You’ll often need to sneak past monstrous enemies, time your movements carefully, and use the environment to your advantage.\nVulnerable Tense Design #At times, the controls can feel a little imprecise, especially during tense chase sequences, but the sense of vulnerability they create adds to the tension. And this can sometimes feel like a downside, though I consider this a plus, since this makes up for a more immersive gameplay due to the character being a child being stalker by monsters. Visually, Little Nightmares is striking, its exaggerated proportions, gloomy lighting, and grotesque character design create a unique horror aesthetic that lingers long after you’ve stopped playing.\nShort Disturbing Masterpiece #The short runtime (around 4~5 hours) works in its favor, keeping the experience tightly focused and impactful without overstaying its welcome. Overall, this title is a chilling, memorable experience that blends horror and artistry in a way few indie titles manage. It’s not just scary, it’s disturbing in a fairy-tale-gone-wrong way, and that’s what makes it so effective.

This unpredictability keeps every run fresh and forces you to adapt constantly.\nCastle of Progression #The game’s procedurally generated castle is full of secrets, traps, and enemies that test both your reflexes and strategy.

Designed specifically for the 3DS, it takes full advantage of the system’s stereoscopic 3D to create depth perception in jumps, enemy placement, and hidden paths, making the handheld’s gimmick feel purposeful rather than just a novelty.\nBite-Sized Clever Levels #The level design strikes a balance between short, digestible stages for handheld play and the kind of inventive, surprising challenges Mario games are known for. Each stage feels tightly crafted, often introducing a new idea and exploring it just enough before moving on to the next. The return of the Tanooki Suit adds a nostalgic charm, while other classic power-ups like the Fire Flower ensure gameplay variety. Although it has shorter levels, it still has some secrets, traditional to the Mario franchise, so keep on the lookout for those while playing.\nRewarding Post-Game Challenge #While the main story can be completed without much struggle, the game shines in its post-game content, where the difficulty ramps up and players are rewarded with more intricate stages and clever twists.

For me, this remains as a beloved PS1 title, remembered for its personality and style as much as for its gameplay, I recommend trying to play this in the new re-releases/remakes for modern platforms, rather than the OG title.\n","date":"19 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/medievil/","section":"Posts","summary":"A cult classic that stands out for its mix of gothic style, humor, and action-adventure gameplay.","title":"MediEvil"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 100 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nClassic CRPG Revival #The first entry to Pillars of Eternity, developed by Obsidian Entertainment, is a crowdfunded isometric RPG that pays loving homage to the classic CRPGs of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Baldur’s Gate and Planescape: Torment. At the heart of the game is the role of the “Watcher,” a rare individual who can see and interact with souls. This unique ability forms the backbone of a story that is rich, morally complex, and deeply personal, as players uncover the mysteries behind a spiritual catastrophe known as the Hollowborn plague. It really gets close on the feeling of playing a computer version of a table-top RPG campaign.\nMorally Complex Narrative #The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is one of the most compelling aspects of the game. You traverse the continent of Eora, exploring diverse regions from bustling cities to dangerous wilderness, encountering political conflicts, ancient secrets, and moral dilemmas. One standout quest involves unraveling the mystery of the Hollowborn: investigating the disappearance of unborn children and uncovering the dark forces at work behind this tragedy. This quest is both emotionally impactful and intellectually engaging, reflecting the game’s strength in blending story and gameplay.\nMemorable Companions #Companions are another highlight of the game, each with distinct personalities, backstories, and quests. For example, Eder is a charming, battle-hardened warrior with a dry sense of humor and personal struggles that slowly unfold as he journeys with the player. Aloth, a sarcastic wizard, has a tragic past that leads to some of the game’s most emotional moments. Durance, a conflicted priest, challenges players’ moral assumptions and provides opportunities for philosophical discussions about faith and power. Though I confess that I tried to stick to the simplest party layout I could find, since I really just wanted to experience the story, rather than min-max the RPG mechanics, which were complex enough for me to almost no keep up with it.\nTactical RPG Systems #Companion quests often intersect with the main story, creating a layered narrative that rewards careful attention and thoughtful choices. Gameplay is tactical and challenging, combining real-time combat with a pause system that allows precise planning. Battles are strategic, requiring you to balance positioning, abilities, and resources. Character creation is highly detailed: you can customize your race, class, abilities, and even background, which influences both dialogue options and interactions with companions and factions.\nDangerous, Rewarding Exploration #Exploration is rewarding, with hidden treasures, optional dungeons, and lore-rich encounters that make the world feel alive and reactive. But keep on the lookout for traps, some of them can literally take down your entire party, if not careful. You can try to workaround this using trap detection spells and abilities, which I highly recommend having at all times.\nNarrative RPG Masterclass #Ultimately, Pillars of Eternity stands out as a masterclass in narrative-driven RPG design. Its combination of memorable companions, meaningful quests, and a meticulously crafted world ensures that players are not just playing a game but participating in a living, breathing story. For fans of classic RPGs and anyone seeking a rich, immersive, and emotionally resonant experience, this title is definitely is a must-play.\n","date":"19 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/pillars-of-eternity/","section":"Posts","summary":"A crowdfunded isometric RPG that pays loving homage to the classic CRPGs of the late 1990s and early 2000s.","title":"Pillars of Eternity"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 22 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nHype and Premise #When Watch Dogs launched, it was one of Ubisoft’s most hyped new IPs, promising a futuristic open world where hacking was as powerful as a gun. Set in a near-future version of Chicago controlled by the ctOS surveillance network. The MC is called Aiden Pearce, a vigilante hacker seeking revenge after a personal tragedy.\nHacking as Power #The biggest strength of Watch Dogs lies in its hacking mechanics. With just a button press, you can manipulate traffic lights, shut down power grids, explode steam pipes, or hijack security cameras to scout ahead. These abilities add a creative layer to missions, allowing multiple approaches beyond standard gunplay. The city itself is dense and atmospheric, with side activities like criminal investigations, digital trips, and online invasions giving the world more variety.\nLimited Player Freedom #And as I said on other reviews, the \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; on how to approach each mission, or situation, is not really a very well developed, complex or in-depth feature. In the end it all boils down to, if you want to go guns blazing, or stealth. So don\u0026rsquo;t expect immersive sim levels of freedom, it is just enough freedom to use as an excuse, even though the hacking theme would make it up as an amazing way for more creative and complex approaches. On the downside, the story struggles to keep momentum.\nAmbition Over Execution #Aiden is often criticized as a flat and uncharismatic lead, and the revenge-driven plot feels predictable compared to the game’s innovative premise. The driving mechanics also lack polish, with vehicles handling stiffly compared to other open-world titles of the time. This title is an ambitious first entry that introduced exciting ideas but failed to fully deliver on its potential. It’s still enjoyable for those who like experimenting with hacking mechanics in an open-world setting, but it feels more like a proof of concept than a polished classic.\n","date":"19 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/watch-dogs/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of Ubisoft\u0026rsquo;s most hyped new IPs, promising a futuristic open world where hacking was as powerful as a gun.","title":"Watch Dogs"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHaunting Soulslike World #This title is an atmospheric action-RPG that takes strong inspiration from the Souls series while carving out its own identity. Its muted art style, faceless characters, and minimalist world design create a haunting tone that fits well with its themes of light and rebuilding in a ruined land. Exploration is a highlight, as the semi-open world is filled with interconnected areas, secrets, and dungeons, while the settlement you help grow over time adds a rewarding layer of progression.\nLimited Combat Depth #Combat is deliberate and challenging, but it can feel shallow compared to other Souls-likes, with limited weapon variety and some balance issues that make lighter weapons far more practical than heavy ones. Particularly I dislike the fact that there are very feel weapon variety on this game, no heavy two-handed weapons for example, dual-wield ones, or even swords, which are my favorite type of melee weapon. And this is by design, the developers have some kind of issue surrounding swords in videogames, because they are too generic, so instead, they decided to completely remove them from this experience.\nCompanions and Coop #The AI companion system often undermines tense moments due to poor pathfinding or unreliable support, though coop with another player can make the journey far more enjoyable. Unfortunately I never experienced the coop side of this, but I can assure that the single-player lone experience is more than enough if you like the other elements. While Ashen offers memorable moments of discovery and atmosphere, its uneven pacing, sudden difficulty spikes, and limited replay value hold it back from true greatness.\nDistinct Yet Flawed #For those who enjoy exploration and world-building as much as combat, it’s a distinctive experience worth trying, but players looking for deep mechanics and polished systems may find it lacking. I highly recommend not skipping this if you like Soulslike games, it is definitely a high quality one, even more so if you have a friend that can join the coop experience, since a lot of it\u0026rsquo;s mechanics are focused on this kind of experience first and foremost.\n","date":"18 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ashen/","section":"Posts","summary":"An atmospheric action-RPG that takes strong inspiration from the Souls series while carving out its own identity.","title":"Ashen"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 30 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRealism Over Arcade #The first Insurgency entry is a tactical first-person shooter that sets itself apart from mainstream military shooters with its focus on realism and teamwork. The gunplay is unforgiving, with players often going down after just a few shots, which makes every movement and decision matter. The lack of a traditional HUD and minimal on-screen guidance amplify the tension, pushing you to rely on awareness, communication, and coordination rather than arcade-style reflexes.\nGritty Multiplayer Focus #The atmosphere is one of the game’s strongest aspects. Weapons feel powerful, the sound design is sharp and immersive, and firefights carry a gritty, high-stakes intensity. While the graphics were already modest at release, the design choices still manage to create a grounded and believable setting. Multiplayer is where the game shines, with modes that reward patience, precision, and working together with your team. Overall, Insurgency is a demanding but rewarding experience.\nNiche Yet Demanding #It isn’t built for casual play or those looking for cinematic campaigns, but for fans of realistic shooters who value tension, lethality, and teamwork, it delivers a gripping and memorable multiplayer experience. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend this game nowadays because it\u0026rsquo;s player-base is very small, instead I recommend trying it\u0026rsquo;s sequel, called Insurgency Sandstorm, which improves the base game on every aspect possible.\nSource Engine Showcase #One of it\u0026rsquo;s biggest standouts is that this game was made using the Source Engine, the Valve engine which powers games like Half Life and Portal. This shows how flexible and powerful this engine is, even when creating such a niche videogame, which is this tactical realistic slow-paced FPS. Unfortunately I could never experience it\u0026rsquo;s sequel since there are no South America servers, so the high ping level makes this unplayable, even more so because it is as intensive as the first entry.\n","date":"18 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/insurgency/","section":"Posts","summary":"A tactical FPS that sets itself apart from mainstream military shooters with its focus on realism and teamwork.","title":"Insurgency"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRestoring a Broken World #This title is one of those early-90s action RPGs that flew under the radar yet left a lasting impression on players who discovered it. At first glance, it looks like a simple Zelda clone, but the gameplay loop has a unique twist: every dungeon you clear directly restores parts of the overworld. Beating a set of monsters doesn’t just reward you with experience, it might rebuild a house, free a villager, or even bring an animal back into existence. This mechanic gives progression a tangible weight, making each victory feel like it truly matters.\nSimple Yet Meaningful Combat #The combat is straightforward and responsive, with sword swings and magic attacks that keep things accessible without being overly repetitive. Exploration is tied tightly to dungeon-clearing, and there’s a pleasant rhythm between fighting enemies and returning to see the world slowly come alive again. While the story is fairly minimal, it carries an undercurrent of melancholy and hope, touching on themes of destruction, sacrifice, and renewal.\nAtmosphere Through Music #Visually, it’s serviceable rather than stunning, functional sprite work with a clear SNES style, but nothing groundbreaking compared to its contemporaries. The soundtrack, however, is outstanding, carrying much of the game’s emotional weight with atmospheric tracks that balance somber tones with uplifting melodies. It doesn’t quite reach the mechanical polish or grandeur of A Link to the Past, but its blend of action, world-building, and thematic depth give it a personality all its own.\nCult Classic Charm #For fans of SNES-era RPGs, Soul Blazer remains a cult classic worth seeking out, both as a historical curiosity and as a surprisingly poignant adventure. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understood the hype behind this game, but once I started playing this I got completely addicted to it\u0026rsquo;s gameplay loop, even though it uses very common and generic elements of other games, it still feels very unique.

The MC is a detective called Sebastian Castellanos, who is drawn into a twisted, nightmarish world after investigating a gruesome mass murder. The game excels at creating a constant sense of dread, with dark, claustrophobic environments, grotesque enemies, and sudden, shocking encounters that keep players on edge.\nPunishing Survival Combat #Combat is deliberate and punishing, ammunition is scarce, enemies are relentless, and even routine encounters can become deadly if approached carelessly. This game is really hardcore when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s survival horror elements, way above the average game of the same genre, so be careful when you choose the difficulty level to experience this. Stealth is often more effective, and a must on hard mode, than brute force, emphasizing the vulnerability of the protagonist and heightening the tension.\nSurreal Lasting Terror #The narrative is surreal and fragmented, blending psychological horror with disturbing imagery, which can be intriguing but also occasionally confusing. The game succeeds at delivering a genuinely frightening experience, its monster designs are grotesque and memorable, the sound design is unsettling, and the atmosphere is consistently oppressive. For fans of survival horror who appreciate suspense, resource management, and disturbing visuals, this title provides an immersive experience that sticks with you long after the credits roll, it is truly a must-play for this genre.\n","date":"18 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-evil-within/","section":"Posts","summary":"A survival horror game from Shinji Mikami, and it clearly reflects his signature style of tense, atmospheric horror.","title":"The Evil Within"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 3 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nPromising First Impression #I tried The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, but I couldn’t get past the first few hours. At first, the gothic steampunk setting and the banter with Lady Katarina felt charming, and the game definitely had the right atmosphere. The presentation looked promising and it seemed like it could be a fun Diablo-style action RPG.\nRepetitive Gameplay Issues #After a while, though, it became hard to stay interested. The combat loop of mowing down mobs and picking up loot started to feel repetitive very quickly, and the enemy variety wasn’t enough to keep me engaged. The story also didn’t pull me in, there’s a lot of lore and names thrown around, but it didn’t feel rewarding or compelling early on. On top of that, the interface and controls felt a bit clunky.\nClunky Systems, Weak Hook #Managing skills and inventory wasn’t as smooth as it should have been, which made the grind more noticeable. The pacing also dragged, it never really escalated in a way that made me want to keep going. In the end, it wasn’t a bad game, just one that didn’t hook me strongly enough to justify the time investment. It felt solid but forgettable, and without a stronger early pull, I lost interest before it had a chance to really shine.\nGenre Preference Mismatch #I can totally see somebody which enjoys action RPG that are Diablo-like really liking this title though, unfortunately for me, I\u0026rsquo;m not that kind of person anymore. Ever since I fell in love with Soulslike action RPG titles, I simply cannot enjoy the Diablo-likes anymore, I feel that Soulslikes are superior in every way, as action RPGs.

The MC is called Eddie Riggs, voiced with great energy by Jack Black, a roadie who gets transported into a fantasy realm built from the imagery of album covers, guitars, and stage pyrotechnics. The game’s personality shines through its writing, humor, and sheer dedication to celebrating metal culture, with cameos from legends like Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy Kilmister adding to its authenticity.\nGreat Combat, Divisive RTS #The soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular, packed with classic and underground metal tracks that elevate every battle and road trip across its stylized landscapes. Combat with Eddie’s axe and guitar feels satisfying, and driving the customizable \u0026ldquo;Druid Plow\u0026rdquo; through hordes of enemies is a joy. However, the game’s sudden reliance on large-scale real-time strategy battles can be divisive. These sections often feel less refined and clash with the otherwise smooth hack-and-slash experience, and particularly speaking this made me drop the game.\nFlawed Yet Memorable #In my opinion, this game would be almost perfect if the RTS sections were removed, and this is not just be, a lot of people feel the same way, unfortunately. Still, Brütal Legend remains a cult classic for its creativity, atmosphere, and unapologetic devotion to metal. It’s a flawed but unforgettable experience, more memorable for its world, characters, and music than for its mechanics.

Built on the old Half-Life engine, it manages to create a deeply oppressive tone through eerie environments, disturbing enemy designs, and an effective soundscape that keeps you on edge. The story dives into themes of depression, trauma, and anxiety, giving it more weight than many horror titles of its time, and its multiple endings add replay value for those curious about different outcomes.\nRough Yet Deep #At first, this may sound like a cheap jump-scare game, but you quickly realize this has a very good level of depth to it\u0026rsquo;s story, even more so if you do some research post-credits. Another issue is that it feels like a rip-off of Half-Life since it is using it\u0026rsquo;s engine, but this is due to it\u0026rsquo;s development not being ideal, it was born as a Half-Life mod, but quickly became it\u0026rsquo;s own thing. And I honestly recommend this for fans of Silent Hill and alike, despite it\u0026rsquo;s low level of quality when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s production, this title is very unique and a must-play for fans of psychological horror.\nAged Mechanics, Strong Mood #That said, the game shows its age in places, the dated graphics and clunky mechanics can make certain sections, like platforming or inventory management, frustrating. Combat can feel uneven, with awkward controls and pacing that sometimes drags. While the atmosphere is strong, the game also leans heavily on jump scares, which may lose their impact the longer you play.\nFlawed, Chilling Gem #Despite its flaws, Cry of Fear remains a memorable and chilling experience, especially considering it is free on Steam. It’s best suited for players who value story, mood, and psychological depth over polish and modern gameplay smoothness. For fans of indie horror with patience for rough edges, it’s a hidden gem worth exploring. I also highly recommend playing the coop campaign, especially if you can get some friends along to join, and if not, it is still a good time even alone. Just keep in mind the coop campaign is balanced towards having multiple players, at least two, and since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any features of adapting itself to how many people are playing, expect a very high level of difficulty if played alone.\n","date":"17 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/cry-of-fear/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game is a psychological horror game that stands out for its unsettling atmosphere and dark narrative.","title":"Cry of Fear"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nDual Heroes, Balanced Design #The 5th Mega Man X entry is often seen as a turning point for the series, carrying forward the strong action-platforming roots of its predecessors while experimenting with new mechanics. You once again take control of X and Zero, each offering distinct playstyles: X with his long-range charged shots and armor customization, and Zero with his close-range saber combat and speed-oriented techniques. This dual-character approach adds replayability and encourages experimenting with different strategies across the game’s varied stages. I highly recommend playing and replaying with both of them, this way you get to experience both playstyles, I can\u0026rsquo;t praise this title enough for having a very balanced level design in order to make both playable characters as viable options.\nClassic Gameplay With Pressure #The level design remains faithful to the series, with tricky platforming sections, challenging enemy placements, and iconic boss fights that reward memorization and skill. The traditional weapon-copying mechanic is intact, giving you new abilities after each victory, though balance between some weapons is uneven. Exploration is rewarded with hidden armor parts and items, though the game’s newly introduced countdown timer—tied to the story’s orbital colony threat, can sometimes create pressure that clashes with the otherwise exploration-heavy design.\nAmbitious Lore, Strong Legacy #Narratively, X5 attempts to deepen the lore with more dialogue and multiple possible endings, but the frequent interruptions slow the pacing and sometimes break the flow of gameplay. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is a high point, with energetic tracks that match the intensity of the action, not that this is a first in the series but it is still a big standout which is hard not to mention. This Mega Man X entry delivers a strong dose of classic run-and-gun platforming, memorable bosses, and a mix of new ideas that, for better or worse, set the tone for the rest of the series on the PlayStation. It is definitely a must-play for fans of this franchise, play this any way you can, I recommend the more modern re-releases which bundles a collection of all the old retro entries such as this one.\n","date":"17 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/mega-man-x5/","section":"Posts","summary":"A turning point for the series, carrying forward the strong action-platforming roots of its predecessors.","title":"Mega Man X5"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Stunning Evolution #The second Ori entry is a visually stunning action-platformer, as a sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest. It expands the original with a larger world, improved combat mechanics, and a more intricate narrative. The hand-painted visuals and fluid animations, combined with the evocative soundtrack, create an immersive and emotionally resonant experience. The first title was already a very high level game through literally all of it\u0026rsquo;s aspects, mechanics, visuals and OST, and it is incredible that this sequel was able to expand this even further.\nCombat Takes Center Stage #The gameplay introduces a more robust combat system, featuring weapons like the Spirit Edge sword and the Smash hammer, as well as skill stones that allow customization of Ori’s abilities. Combat is it\u0026rsquo;s biggest standout in my opinion, when compared to the first title, which was more about exploration and platforming, but this new one has much more depth, adding enough complexity to feel more like an action platformer. Platforming challenges and chase sequences demand precision and quick reflexes, providing both excitement and difficulty for most people.\nEmotional, Masterful Journey #The story follows Ori and their owl companion Ku, navigating a beautifully crafted world filled with danger and wonder.

This was a bold stylistic choice at the time, and it helped Paper Mario stand apart from both traditional Mario platformers and other role-playing games. This really has a feel like a sequel to the Mario RPG from the SNES, not just because of it\u0026rsquo;s combat mechanics, but on a overall gameplay feel, so if you liked the ones from SNES, then there is no excuse not to play this one.\nCharming Classic Story #The story is straightforward, Bowser has stolen the Star Rod and captured Princess Peach, and Mario must gather the power of the Star Spirits to defeat him, but it’s told with a surprising amount of humor and charm. Along the way, Mario is joined by a variety of partners, each with their own personalities and abilities, such as Goombario with his headbonk or Bombette with her explosive skills. So again, this really feels like the SNES counterpart down to the pacing and characters. These partners aren’t just helpful in combat but are also key to solving puzzles in the overworld, which keeps exploration fresh.\nInteractive Turn-Based Combat #Combat uses a turn-based system but adds timing-based action commands, where pressing a button at the right moment can increase damage or reduce it when defending. This mechanic keeps battles interactive and more engaging than the typical “select attack and wait” style found in many RPGs of that era. This makes up for a much more dynamic combat system, while at the same time, being accessible enough because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really introduces a lot of complexity. The badge system also provides customization, letting players adjust Mario’s abilities to fit their playstyle, adding some depth to the combat features.\nAccessible RPG Classic #While it isn’t as complex or lengthy as other RPGs like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger, Paper Mario succeeds through its balance of accessibility, lighthearted storytelling, and polished design. Its mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and character-driven humor makes it one of the standout titles on the Nintendo 64, and it laid the groundwork for what would become one of Nintendo’s most beloved RPG series. This is definitely one of the best RPGs that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, but I\u0026rsquo;m biased since I like alternative games, so if you are expecting a traditional RPG, or even JRPG, then I would stay away from this one, but this is a must-play for Mario fans.

Set in the kingdom of Ivalice, the story follows Ramza Beoulve, a young noble caught between loyalty to his family, the corruption of the aristocracy, and the struggles of commoners in a land torn apart by war. Unlike many other Final Fantasy entries, this game focuses less on grand fantasy tropes and more on themes of betrayal, class conflict, and moral ambiguity, making its story unusually mature and grounded for the era.\nDeep Tactical Freedom #This game\u0026rsquo;s story has way more depth compared to other entries in the series, despite it having a cute art-style, not to mention the amount of characters and complex plots you need to keep up with. That being said, if regular FF is already complex enough for you, then I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend this one, because it escalates this trait by a lot. Gameplay unfolds on grid-based battlefields where careful positioning, job selection, and long-term planning are crucial. The job system is a highlight, offering tremendous freedom to shape your army by mixing and matching skills across dozens of classes, from traditional knights and mages to unique options like calculators and ninjas.\nPunishing Strategic Mastery #This depth ensures that no two playthroughs are exactly alike. Battles can be punishing, but the challenge makes every victory satisfying. If you like party RPGs in general, than this is one of the best games you can experience, because you\u0026rsquo;ll practically be managing multiple different characters, and this is not limited to their equipment, but their progression in general. Complementing the strategic gameplay is a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, which enhances the game’s serious tone, and an amazing OST is already a trait in the series. Although the original English translation was awkward at times, the core story and atmosphere still shine through.\nTimeless Tactical Classic #With its complex systems, mature themes, and innovative approach to RPG storytelling, Final Fantasy Tactics remains a cornerstone of the genre and a beloved cult classic that influenced countless tactical RPGs in the years that followed. This is truly one of the best RPGs of all time and a must-play for people who like this genre to any extent, especially if you play using the recent re-releases for modern platforms, as for me I choose to play the original version in the original platform, and to replay it via emulation later in time.

It is impressive how this engine can achieve to create such diverse games, while still feeling modern enough to support indie developers with unique ideas, not to mention it is still powering a lot of mods being made for existing games, which sometimes become their own thing.\nStylish Level Design #The level design stands out in particular, offering large, detailed spaces that reward exploration and make firefights feel dynamic and unpredictable. The presentation leans into retro style without feeling outdated. Pixelated visuals are enhanced with modern lighting effects and small interactive touches, giving each stage a lot of personality. The sound design, from punchy weapon effects to a fitting soundtrack, complements the chaotic action and keeps the adrenaline high, this is truly one of the most stylish titles that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced.\nFaithful Genre Throwback #That said, Ion Fury doesn’t try to push the genre forward. Its narrative is paper-thin, mostly an excuse to throw waves of enemies at the player, and the environments can start to feel repetitive after a while. Overall, Ion Fury succeeds at what it sets out to do: delivering a faithful, exciting throwback to the golden age of shooters. For fans of old-school FPS design, it’s a thrilling ride filled with satisfying action and nostalgic charm, though those looking for innovation or a strong story may find it a little lacking. This is truly one of the best oldschool shooters that I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced, I highly recommend not skipping it if you like this sub-genre.\n","date":"16 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ion-fury/","section":"Posts","summary":"A love letter to classic \u0026rsquo;90s FPSs, built on a modernized version of the old Build engine (Duke Nukem 3D, Blood).","title":"Ion Fury"},{"content":" 🎮 Super Nintendo ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nClassic Ninja Collection #This title bundles together the three NES titles, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, and Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom, into a single cartridge. On paper, it sounds like the perfect way to experience Ryu Hayabusa’s saga on newer hardware. The fast-paced action, wall-climbing, and signature cinematic cutscenes that made the series famous are all still here, preserving the tough but rewarding gameplay.\nInferior SNES Port #However, the compilation is often considered disappointing. The SNES port features simplified visuals, weaker sound effects, and reworked music that loses some of the sharp energy of the originals. Certain cutscene animations were cut, further reducing the impact of the story presentation. While the challenge and core mechanics remain intact, the collection feels stripped down compared to the NES versions.\nConvenient Yet Flawed #For newcomers, it offers a convenient way to play all three games in one place, but for long-time fans, it lacks the polish and intensity that defined the originals, making it more of a curiosity than the definitive version. I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this title enough if you like hard games, or action platformers in general, but if you have a hard time dealing with frustration then I recommend staying away from this one, since it is very punishing, and very unfair.\n","date":"16 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ninja-gaiden-trilogy/","section":"Posts","summary":"A bundle with the three NES titles, I, II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, and Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom.","title":"Ninja Gaiden Trilogy"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 20 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nPost-Order 66 Survival #This title is a single-player action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment that places players in the Star Wars universe shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith. The MC is called Cal Kestis, a young Jedi Padawan, as he struggles to survive while rebuilding the Jedi Order. The game delivers a strong narrative with emotional character interactions, particularly between Cal and his droid companion, BD-1. It really tries to make you like the characters involved in the plot, but I find it hard to like them, in general they are not quite as likable as other similar to most narrative Sony titles, for example, which has a similar approach to their characters.\nChallenging Exploration Combat #The combat system is precise and challenging, emphasizing timing, strategy, and mastery of both lightsaber duels and Force abilities. Exploration is a key component, with interconnected worlds that encourage backtracking with new abilities to uncover secrets and fully experience each planet. This Metroidvania-style design makes progression rewarding and keeps players engaged throughout the adventure. Some people even consider this a Soulslike due to it\u0026rsquo;s difficulty level, and while I agree with this, I also think this is more of an adventure title, than an RPG one, since it\u0026rsquo;s RPG mechanics are way more limited than the traditional Soulslike, which you can experiment with different builds.\nAuthentic Yet Familiar #While the game excels in atmosphere and Star Wars authenticity, it has minor drawbacks. Some technical issues, such as inconsistent parrying mechanics and occasional frame drops, can disrupt the flow of combat. The story, although engaging, occasionally follows familiar Star Wars tropes, which may feel predictable to some players. Overall, this game is a captivating experience that successfully blends exploration, challenging combat, and narrative.

Its standout mechanic is that time only progresses when you move, which transforms each firefight into a tense and strategic puzzle. Instead of reacting on pure reflex, you’re constantly analyzing enemy positions, dodging incoming bullets in slow motion, and deciding the most efficient way to use whatever weapons or objects are nearby. I would only recommend this title for people who likes puzzles, but not necessarily shooters, this may sound strange, but it makes all the sense once you start playing.\nStyle, Strategy, Meta #The result is a game that feels both cerebral and cinematic, giving you moments that look like choreographed action sequences but are really the product of careful planning. The minimalist art style, stark white environments with bright red enemies, isn’t just visually striking, it also reinforces clarity and focus in the chaos. The campaign itself is relatively short, but tightly designed and memorable, with a strange meta-narrative that blurs the line between player and game. If you like alternative story-telling then this is one of the best titles you can get, and if not, the only thing you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy here is the gameplay since there is not really a big plot with characters, dialogs and any traditional elements.\nReplayable Innovation #After finishing the story, endless and challenge modes provide plenty of replayability, encouraging you to refine your strategies and experiment with different playstyles. While some may find the length of the main story underwhelming, the game’s originality, atmosphere, and addictive gameplay loop make it stand out as one of the most innovative shooters of its era. This is one of the best puzzle (or even shooter) game that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played and a must-play if you like these genres to any extent.\n","date":"16 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/superhot/","section":"Posts","summary":"The first Superhot entry is a FPS that completely rethinks how the genre works.","title":"Superhot"},{"content":" 🎮 Nintendo 64 ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nBomberman Reinvented #This Nintendo 64 Bomberman entry is one of the more experimental entries in the long-running series, pushing the formula beyond its traditional maze-based battles. The game offers a fully fleshed-out single-player adventure, where Bomberman explores diverse 3D environments, solves puzzles, and battles bosses using an expanded elemental bomb system. Each element, fire, water, wind, and more, adds variety to combat and puzzle-solving, giving the gameplay a sense of progression that earlier Bomberman titles lacked.\nPommy and Story #A standout feature is Pommy, Bomberman’s creature companion, who can evolve into different forms depending on how you treat and feed it. This mechanic adds personality and replay value, making the adventure feel less solitary, and while we had other companions in the past, especially in the SNES entries, this one in particular is very unique. The game’s story, while simple, is surprisingly developed for the series, with cutscenes and characters that give the journey more weight than most Bomberman titles.\nAmbitious Cult Classic #That said, the game has its flaws. The camera can be clunky in 3D spaces, occasionally making platforming sections frustrating, and the pacing sometimes drags due to uneven level design. Its multiplayer mode, usually the highlight of any Bomberman game, is present but less engaging than earlier entries, as the focus was clearly on the single-player experience. Despite these shortcomings, The Second Attack has become a cult favorite. Its ambition, depth, and charm make it stand out as one of the most unique Bomberman games, even if it isn’t the most polished.\n","date":"15 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bomberman-64-the-second-attack/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the most experimental entries in the long-running series, going beyond its traditional maze-based battles.","title":"Bomberman 64 The Second Attack"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 50 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nCombat Meets Puzzles #This title is a retro-inspired action RPG that combines fast-paced combat with clever puzzle design. Set within the framework of a fictional MMORPG, it offers a unique narrative hook while delivering a single-player experience. The game shines with its fluid combat system, which blends melee and ranged attacks and incorporates elemental powers to keep encounters dynamic and engaging. Its puzzles, often physics-based and requiring precise aim or timing, are equally rewarding, though sometimes they can feel overly demanding.\nPixel Art Excellence #Visually, CrossCode is a treat for fans of 16-bit aesthetics, featuring detailed pixel art and smooth animations that evoke the best of SNES-era RPGs, even resembling classic JRPG art-styles. The soundtrack enhances the atmosphere with energetic and emotional tracks, complementing both intense battles and quieter moments of exploration, and again, similar to JRPGs, the soundtrack is one of it\u0026rsquo;s standouts.\nExceptional Side Quests #The world itself is expansive, filled with dungeons, quests, and secrets that encourage thorough exploration, giving players dozens of hours of content to uncover. This is one of the best games when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s side-quests, very few games makes me want to play all of them. And I dare to say this has the same level of quality of the Final Fantasy XII hunting side-quests, which it really makes you want to find all the prays and complete all the side-quests related to them.\nAmbition and Pacing #On the downside, the game’s pacing can occasionally falter, some dungeons feel overly long, and certain puzzles may test patience with their precision requirements. The story, while intriguing, takes its time to build momentum, which might not suit players looking for a more immediate narrative payoff. Despite these issues, CrossCode remains a standout indie RPG, praised for its polish, depth, and the way it captures the spirit of classic games while adding modern twists.\nFlawed Indie Masterpiece #This is one of the best indies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, it has an insane plot twist at the end, which I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil, and also cliffhanger for a DLC can be later enjoyed. I can\u0026rsquo;t say much about it\u0026rsquo;s DLC though, since I was burnt out after I saw the credits rolling, because even though this is an amazing title, it is a very very long one. So be prepared to get overwhelmed sometimes if you played this like me, from start to finish, this shows it has some serious pacing issues. Despite this, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to play the other games this developer is creating, and if you are a fan of action RPGs to any extent, this is definitely a must-play in my opinion.\n","date":"15 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/crosscode/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a retro-inspired action RPG that combines fast-paced combat with clever puzzle design.","title":"CrossCode"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nSpellcraft Power Fantasy #This game is a first-person action RPG that puts you in the role of a powerful mage, removing traditional weapons in favor of a deep and flexible spellcrafting system. The ability to combine magical elements and modifiers to create custom spells is the highlight of the game, offering a strong sense of power and creativity. Casting feels impactful, with flashy effects and a satisfying sense of control over destructive magic.\nDepth Versus Repetition #And although the spell system seems to be complex, in practice, you\u0026rsquo;ll mostly be using the same spells most of the time, on most situations, it won\u0026rsquo;t blow you away like, lets say, Magicka for example, which has way more viable options for builds. The game struggles with repetition and pacing, the linear level design and limited enemy variety make combat encounters feel samey after a while, and difficulty spikes can make progression frustrating.\nUnrealized Potential #The visuals and spell effects are often impressive, especially in later fights with many effects on screen. The story is serviceable but largely forgettable, and the focus is firmly on combat rather than narrative or exploration. Overall, this title delivers a fun mage power fantasy for players who enjoy experimenting with spells, but its lack of variety prevent it from fully realizing its potential. It’s a solid choice if you want a unique magic-focused experience, and I wished we had a more polished sequel that would mitigate the flaws of this particular entry.\n","date":"15 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/lichdom-battlemage/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a first-person action RPG that puts you in the role of a powerful mage.","title":"Lichdom Battlemage"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nAuthentic Retro Homage #This game is a retro-styled action platformer that pays heavy homage to the 8-bit era, especially NES classics like Ninja Gaiden. Its pixel art, chiptune soundtrack, and cinematic cutscenes capture the feel of late ’80s gaming, and the developers clearly aimed to recreate both the look and difficulty of that time. I highly recommend looking into the other titles of the same developers if you like this kind of game, since they are all similarly good, very high level if quality nostalgia.\nFair Yet Challenging Gameplay #The game is known for being challenging but generally fair. Levels introduce hazards and enemies in a way that allows players to learn patterns, and boss fights are intense highlights that reward precision and memorization. Controls are tight overall, giving combat and platforming a satisfying sense of responsiveness, though some minor quirks, like crouching, can feel less polished. This is a very good title if you like challenging changes, and also if you have the completionist mindset, since it is short enough to enable you easy NG+ replays.\nShort but Satisfying #On the downside, Oniken is a fairly short experience, and once the learning curve is conquered, runs can be completed quickly. Its adherence to retro design also means it leans heavily on familiar tropes. Overall, Oniken succeeds as a love letter to classic 8-bit action games. It offers tough but rewarding gameplay, stylish presentation, and memorable boss battles, though its brevity and retro quirks may limit its appeal to players who expect modern conveniences.

Unlike the traditional turn-based RPGs of its era, it features real-time battles where timing and positioning matter, creating a more dynamic feel. For today\u0026rsquo;s standards this may not sound like a big deal, but this title set new standards to action RPGs at the time, especially because of how complex the combat could get, compared to more simpler titles such as ALTTP.\nRing Menu Innovation #The innovative ring menu system (also used in Secret of Evermore) allows players to pause the action briefly to equip weapons, cast spells, or use items, keeping the pace fluid without overwhelming the player. The game also shines in its cooperative multiplayer, letting up to three players join forces, a rare and highly memorable feature for the genre at the time. Unfortunately I never experienced the coop experience since I never played this back in the day, and I choose the original version of this game to play, but I highly recommend the newer versions which are more accessible, for modern platforms.\nCharm Over Flaws #Its vibrant pixel art and expressive animations give the world a sense of warmth and charm, while the soundtrack is still celebrated for its emotional range, from mysterious forest themes to grand battle tracks. That said, Secret of Mana isn’t without flaws, hit detection can feel imprecise, and AI-controlled companions often struggle to keep up in combat. Still, these issues are outweighed by the game’s sense of wonder, accessibility, and cooperative spirit. Decades later, it remains a standout in the SNES library and a milestone in the evolution of action RPGs, this is a must-play for fans of JRPG in general, and I suggest going with the re-releases for modern platforms, don\u0026rsquo;t skip this.\n","date":"15 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/secret-of-mana/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the most iconic RPGs of SNES, praised for blending fast-paced combat with a storybook-like adventure.","title":"Secret of Mana"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 43 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nDefinitive Classic Package #Quake II Remaster by Nightdive Studios is the definitive way to experience id Software’s 1997 classic. It bundles the full base campaign with enhanced visuals, improved AI, modern lighting, and accessibility options, while also including every major piece of additional content ever released. Alongside the base game, the package comes with The Reckoning and Ground Zero, two classic expansion packs, the Nintendo 64 port, and a brand-new campaign called Call of the Machine developed by MachineGames.\nQuality-of-Life Improvements #One of it\u0026rsquo;s biggest standouts in my opinion, when it comes to QOL improvements, is the Compass usable item, which will help you find your way to the next objective. This is one of the biggest problems of the original game, it\u0026rsquo;s levels are very hard to navigate, and I can see a lot of people dropping the game mid-way through because of this. The Reckoning and Ground Zero are faithful to their original forms, offering new levels, weapons, and enemies. While they extend the Quake II experience, they are often regarded as less inventive than the main campaign, providing solid but conventional expansions that are more appealing to completionists and fans than newcomers.\nFirst-Time Appreciation #Even though this was my first time playing this title (my first ever Quake was Quake 4) I absolutely loved it, not just the base game, but the expansions are amazing, especially Call of The Machine. The other two expansions are not bad, but they just feel like more content for the base game, no complaints here. But call of The Machine is the best in my opinion because you play different levels, starting from scratch on each one, and this shifts the game\u0026rsquo;s dynamic enough to make it more interesting, especially when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s level design.\nMachineGames’ Standout Expansion #MachineGames expansion reimagines Quake II with more varied environments, creative encounters, and relentless pacing. Many people and critics consider it stronger and more exciting than the base game itself, with its large-scale battles and inventive map design capturing the essence of old-school shooters while still feeling fresh. So I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely not alone on this opinion, and I highly recommend not skipping this content if you are deciding which one you should play after finishing the base game.\nMust-Play Shooter Legacy #Overall, Nightdive’s remaster is both a preservation project and a revitalization, the package is content-rich, affordable, and accessible, making it the best way to revisit Quake II or experience it for the first time. The classic expansions add historical value, but Call of the Machine stands out as the crown jewel of the collection, proving that Quake II’s formula can still shine with the right creative push. This is no doubt one of the best shooters of all time, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got to experience all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents in one sitting, and I took a while since there are enough levels to play on this package that it can even tire you sometimes. This is one of the utmost \u0026ldquo;must-play\u0026rdquo; shooters of all time, if you like shooters to any extent, this is an obligatory title you should experience.\n","date":"5 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/quake-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"Quake II Remaster by Nightdive Studios is the definitive way to experience id Software\u0026rsquo;s 1997 classic.","title":"Quake II"},{"content":" 🎮 Game Boy Advance ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nPortable Crash Adaptation #This Crash Bandicoot GBA entry is an impressive effort to bring Naughty Dog’s iconic platformer to the Game Boy Advance. Developed by Vicarious Visions, it reimagines the series’ familiar 3D gameplay into a 2D side-scrolling format while keeping the core mechanics intact, running, jumping, spinning, and collecting Wumpa fruit across linear but varied stages. The game includes staples like hidden gems, bonus rounds, and boss fights, giving it the same sense of progression fans expect from the series.\nSide-Scrolling Focus #For people familiar with his franchise, it is like playing a Crash game that almost only has the side-scrolling platforming levels, even though it does have a couple of different sections here and there, but for the most part, this is how this title feels like. Visually, it does a great job of replicating the vibrant and cartoony aesthetic of the PlayStation originals. The sprite work is sharp, animations are smooth, and backgrounds capture the tropical and mechanical themes Crash is known for.\nResponsive Yet Accessible #The controls are tight and responsive, which is crucial for the game’s mix of platforming and precision jumps. That said, the handheld format does introduce some limitations, though I admit that I played this using a full-sized controller, so it was a non-issue for me. Levels are shorter and more straightforward, the variety of environments isn’t as wide as in the console entries, and the overall challenge is tuned to be more accessible.\nSatisfying Completionist Experience #I highly recommend trying to 100% this one, it is as satisfying as the versions for regular non-handheld consoles, and sometimes it is an even more pleasant experience since this is meant to be simpler, shorter and more concise, so not a big journey to 100%. Despite these constraints, it stands as a faithful and entertaining portable Crash game, one that retains the spirit of the franchise while adapting cleverly to the GBA’s hardware.\n","date":"4 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/crash-bandicoot-the-huge-adventure/","section":"Posts","summary":"This Crash Bandicoot GBA entry is an impressive effort to bring Naughty Dog’s iconic platformer to the Game Boy Advance.","title":"Crash Bandicoot The Huge Adventure"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nFluid Cyberpunk Action #This title is a fast-paced first-person action platformer set in a neon-soaked cyberpunk dystopia.

Every encounter feels like a puzzle of movement and timing, pushing players to chain together perfect runs through deadly environments.\nPunishing Skill-Based Difficulty #The game’s difficulty is one of its defining traits, death comes instantly from a single mistake, but generous checkpoints and quick reloads keep the momentum flowing. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t like games with \u0026ldquo;easy-death\u0026rdquo; mechanics, stir away from this one, because it\u0026rsquo;ll not be a good time for you. Mastering its mechanics delivers a genuine rush, though some players may find the trial-and-error design frustrating.\nStylish Aesthetic and Sound #Visually, it stands out with its stylish cyberpunk aesthetic, sharp animations, and pulsing electronic soundtrack that perfectly matches the intensity of the gameplay. And even though I\u0026rsquo;m highly biased because I\u0026rsquo;m a Synthwave fan, I still think this game has a very amazing OST, it is definitely one of it\u0026rsquo;s standouts. The narrative, however, plays only a minor role and often feels like background noise compared to the adrenaline of the action, it is still there, but very lacking and with very few to no characters involved on it.\nDemanding Yet Rewarding Experience #Overall, Ghostrunner is a thrilling but demanding experience, it is best suited for people who enjoy fast reflex challenges and the satisfaction of overcoming brutally precise gameplay rather than those seeking a story-driven adventure.

The use of Psynergy, essentially the game’s form of magic, extends beyond combat into exploration and puzzle-solving. somewhat similar to some mechanics in Breath of Fire IV (PlayStation). Whether it’s moving objects, revealing hidden paths, or manipulating the environment, Psynergy ensures dungeons feel interactive and rewarding rather than linear slogs.\nTechnical and Narrative Ambition #This blend of combat and puzzle design makes the world feel alive and gives players constant reasons to experiment. On a technical level, this title is one of the most impressive-looking GBA ones, the bright, detailed environments and smooth character animations make the game visually striking, and the summon sequences push the system to its limits with dazzling effects. Narratively, the game starts with a familiar “young heroes against an ancient evil” setup, but it gradually unfolds into something more layered, especially once you realize it’s only half of a larger saga.\nDialogue-Heavy Yet Essential #While the story is charming and filled with likable characters, some people may find the dialogue-heavy pacing a little slow, especially early on.

The character-switching mechanic adds variety, especially when paired with local co-op, making the experience more dynamic and engaging. And while this is not something new when it comes to Capcom titles, it is brilliantly implemented here, which is also nice when paired with the episodic format, somewhat similar to the first Alan Wake title.\nAtmosphere and Replay Value #Some people at the time praised the game’s atmosphere, the interplay between characters, and the addictive Raid Mode, which provided strong replay value. Though I admit that I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite explored these gameplay formats, I just enjoyed the main story and then I was done with the game. The episodic cliffhangers kept the narrative engaging, and the pacing, while uneven at times, often delivered satisfying bursts of tension.\nTechnical and Design Flaws #On the downside, visuals were considered underwhelming compared to other titles from the same era, with weak textures and limited detail. And in my opinion this is totally understandable since this was originally meant for the PlayStation Vita platform. The absence of online co-op in the story campaign disappointed many people, and some episodes felt padded or repetitive.\nDivisive Yet Worthwhile #Over time, fans have remained divided.

The game is built around fluid traversal mechanics, sprinting and gliding across vast landscapes while hitting targets with a bow to maintain momentum creates a unique sense of flow and freedom.\nAtmospheric Presentation Strength #One of the game’s strongest aspects is its presentation. The stylized art direction gives the world a painterly, almost mythical feel, and the OST adds emotional depth to both quiet exploration and intense boss encounters. The bond with the eagle companion also enhances the atmosphere, making traversal and puzzle-solving more engaging while adding a touch of warmth to an otherwise desolate world. It is clearly inspired by games such as Shadow of The Colossus when it comes to the MC and his companion animal, though not with the same level of depth.\nRepetition and Limitations #However, The Pathless does show its limitations over time, the core puzzles and activities, while elegant at first, repeat often and don’t evolve much as the game progresses. My biggest complain is the side-quests, which are just \u0026ldquo;side-puzzles\u0026rdquo;, they are too numerous, which can be somewhat tedious if you try to do them all like I did. The open world, though beautiful, can feel sparse and lacking in meaningful variety, this makes the journey feel less rewarding for people who prefer more intricate mechanics or denser environments, similar to what we can see with the already mentioned SOTC.\nMovement-Driven Experience #Overall, The Pathless succeeds as a meditative and graceful adventure, it\u0026rsquo;s strengths lie in movement, mood, and presentation rather than complexity or depth. At first, the standout for me was the OST and the visuals, but I stayed playing this until the end solely because of it\u0026rsquo;s amazing movement mechanics, it is truly one of the most satisfying ones I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced. For people seeking a short, atmospheric experience that blends exploration with light puzzle-solving, it offers a memorable journey even if it doesn’t quite sustain its magic throughout.\n","date":"4 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-pathless/","section":"Posts","summary":"A visually striking action-adventure game, developed by the same studio behind Abzû.","title":"The Pathless"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nIdentity-Driven Puzzle Mechanics #This game is an atmospheric puzzle-platformer, set on a mysterious and abandoned research station. Its central mechanic revolves around a device that allows you to create clones of yourself and swap your consciousness between them, leading to puzzles that are both clever and thematically tied to questions of identity and existence. At first I thought it would have a complex story, with mysteries, interpretative sections and some characters, but in the end it is just a pretext for the gameplay, nothing more than that.\nHaunting Artistic Presentation #The game’s handmade clay and model-based art style, combined with eerie lighting and ambient sound, gives it a haunting, otherworldly feel that perfectly matches its philosophical tone. The puzzles escalate in complexity with mechanics like light restrictions and gravity, keeping the challenge engaging without overwhelming the player. I confess that I struggled a lot in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, mid-way through, it becomes a breeze and a very satisfying puzzle game experience.\nFocused Cryptic Experience #While relatively short, about four hours, the game’s brevity works in its favor, maintaining a focused experience that blends cerebral puzzle-solving with thought-provoking narrative elements. Its story is deliberately cryptic, inviting interpretation, and it resonates strongly with people who enjoy games that explore deeper themes of consciousness and humanity. So if you enjoy this kind of plot, which can be a very obscure one, and lacking a lot of explanation deliberately, this is one of the best games you can play.\nInterpretative Yet Memorable #I would argue this game has a bad story simply because it is lacking a lot, but in the end, since this is a very interpretative story, I cannot really say this, what I can say is that sometimes it can feel cheap on this regard, relying too much on it\u0026rsquo;s more interpretative nature. Overall, this is a striking indie title, praised for its originality, mood, and puzzle design. It remains memorable as much for its philosophical weight as for its clever gameplay, making it an excellent choice for fans of atmospheric and contemplative experiences.\n","date":"4 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-swapper/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game is an atmospheric puzzle-platformer, set on a mysterious and abandoned research station.","title":"The Swapper"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 40 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nGothic Soulslike Identity #This game is a 2D action-RPG that mixes Soulslike combat with Metroidvania exploration. Its pixel art and gothic atmosphere are striking, creating a world that feels both haunting and beautiful. The story, centered on a pact with Death, adds to the moody tone and gives the game a distinct identity compared to its inspirations. And the main theme of this game is pretty much very well explored since dying is very easy on this title, and has some mechanics surrounding it.\nRisky Exploration and Bosses #The exploration is one of its strongest aspects, with interconnected areas, shortcuts, and secrets that reward curiosity. The unique death mechanic, where you lose healing plumes instead of currency, adds a refreshing risk, reward layer to progression. This also somewhat forces a more aggressive play-style compared to other games of the same sub-genre, not really an issue for me, but I can see some people not enjoying this. The boss fights also stand out for their design and scale, often feeling like highlights of the journey.\nClunky Combat Execution #Unfortunately, the combat doesn’t always live up to the promise when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s execution, movement and attacks can feel sluggish and unresponsive, which makes encounters more frustrating than challenging. The stamina system is punishing in ways that discourage experimentation, and the more aggressive nature of this game is sometimes overwhelming, even more so than games like Bloodborne.\nStylish Yet Flawed #While this title has plenty of ambition and undeniable style, its rough edges hold it back from greatness. For people who can forgive clunky controls and value atmosphere, world design, and mood above all else, it can still be a memorable adventure.

I lost count of the number of times she got stuck, left behind, or put me in situations that felt unfair rather than challenging. On top of that, crashes, input delays, and even one game-breaking bug completely killed my momentum.\nPotential Left Unfulfilled #I kept telling myself to stick with it, that maybe things would improve or the story would pay off in a big way, but every session left me more drained than invested.

The storybook presentation, colorful cel-shaded visuals, and a charismatic narrator give the game a distinct personality that stands out from other indie titles of its time. This one is yet another title that I got interested in playing it solely because of the art-style, but I finished playing it because of the gameplay.\nFun but Repetitive Combat #Combat is fast-paced and enjoyable, with upgradeable swords and magical abilities that keep fights engaging, at least at first. However, the enemy variety and environments are limited, which makes extended playthroughs feel repetitive. It is indeed not a very complex and replayable game, but this was never the intention, its a short and concise experience. This repetition is the game’s biggest drawback, as pursuing multiple endings often means revisiting similar levels with only slight variations.\nA Worthwhile Hidden Gem #Despite this, the clever writing, humor, and inventive narrative structure make the experience worthwhile. The PC version runs smoothly and remains the best way to enjoy the game. If you like story-driven adventures with meaningful choices and don’t mind some repetition, this game is a hidden gem worth exploring.

This might sound like there are few to no additions compared to the first title, but this one tries to push even further, each element that the first game did very well, being practically a totally improved game in comparison.\nOld-School Challenge Embraced #The pixel art, chiptune-inspired soundtrack, and creative boss designs reinforce its retro appeal, while the multiple episodes and branching paths encourage replayability. The game embraces old-school difficulty, with stiff controls, punishing checkpoints, and enemy placements that often feel designed to test patience as much as skill. Some may find this limitation to be a downside, but personally speaking I like the challenge of these less fluid and more clunky controls, I find it to be a good change of pace when compared to the smooth and twitch-like perfect controls of titles, which is considered the more \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; approach.\nFor Retro Enthusiasts #For people who enjoy tough but fair platforming challenges, this difficulty adds to the satisfaction of overcoming each stage. However, those less accustomed to retro design may find the repetition and rigid mechanics frustrating. Overall, the sequel improves on its predecessor with richer content and more personality, making it a rewarding experience for fans of classic action-platformers. It may not win over everyone with its uncompromising design, but for those who appreciate the challenge, it delivers a nostalgic yet fresh adventure.

The game maintains the franchise’s hallmark combination of horror and first-person shooting, with firefights that feel impactful thanks to meaty weapons, destructible cover, and the signature slow-motion mechanic. Some people think this sequel was very weak compared to the first title, but I think it is a very enjoyable shooter, even though it\u0026rsquo;s story is lacking compared to the original game, especially when it comes to it\u0026rsquo;s ending (no spoilers).\nScripted Fear and Action #Enemy AI is still aggressive and tactical, though encounters tend to be more scripted and less dynamic than in the original, which reduces some of the tension and unpredictability. The horror elements are front and center, relying on jump scares, nightmarish visions, and grotesque imagery tied to Alma’s haunting presence. While these sequences can be chilling, they often feel more straightforward and less psychologically nuanced compared to the eerie subtlety of the first F.E.A.R.. One standout for me are the mecha sequences, which is a nice change of pace but it clearly sets itself to be a more action-focused title at this point, even having some gameplay sections set at daytime.\nPolished but Less Bold #The environments, ranging from devastated cityscapes to claustrophobic interiors, are atmospheric and showcase the visual improvements of the time, though the level design is noticeably more linear, trading open-ended combat arenas for tighter, guided progression. As a whole, F.E.A.R. 2 succeeds as a polished, unsettling shooter with some memorable moments of dread and adrenaline-fueled action. However, it sacrifices a bit of the originality, depth, and razor-sharp combat flow that made its predecessor stand out, which is a hard enough thing to tackle since the first entry was such a groundbreaking game, even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards.\n","date":"2 September 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fear-2-project-origin/","section":"Posts","summary":"The second F.E.A.R. entry is a direct sequel that continues the unsettling story of Alma Wade.","title":"FEAR 2 Project Origin"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nBrutal Surreal Action #The first Hotline Miami entry is a fast, violent, and stylish top-down action game that leaves a strong impression with its mix of brutal gameplay and surreal atmosphere.

Each mission drops you into compact levels filled with armed enemies, and the game demands split-second reactions, one wrong move and you’re dead, forcing you to rethink your approach until you master the rhythm of violence.\nStyle Meets Substance #This is easily one of those memorable games which the gameplay is masterfully crafted, and it is good enough standout, but instead, if also delivers amazing characters, plot twists and an unforgettable mainline story. What sets the game apart is not just its challenge but its presentation. The neon-soaked visuals, drenched in 80s Miami excess, give the carnage a hypnotic flair, while the pulsating electronic soundtrack drives the action with relentless energy.\nInfluential Neon Identity #It definitely left it\u0026rsquo;s mark in the gaming landscape by choosing this art-style, to the point where we got to see a lot of games inspired by this afterwards, and a lot of people thought this style came from this title, instead of it being an already existing music genre, and visual style.

Short, sharp, and endlessly replayable, Hotline Miami has earned its status as a modern indie classic and remains one of the most influential action games of its generation.

The platforming feels responsive and fair, the combat is satisfying, and the “downward shovel strike” quickly becomes one of the most iconic mechanics in indie gaming, even today.\nHeartfelt Pixel Adventure #The pixel art is vibrant and expressive, the chiptune soundtrack is nothing short of legendary, and the story, though simple, has genuine heart, making you care about Shovel Knight and Shield Knight more than you’d expect from an 8-bit homage. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expected much when I first started playing this, but I quickly became a fan, the controls for all the playable characters feels amazing and satisfying. Every stage feels distinct, with memorable bosses that balance challenge and fun in a way few modern platformers achieve.\nIndie Masterpiece Legacy #What pushes it into masterpiece territory is how lovingly crafted it is. It doesn’t just imitate retro games, it reimagines them, proving that nostalgia can fuel innovation. Shovel Knight stands proudly alongside the all-time greats and is a shining example of how indie games can rival (and sometimes surpass) big-budget titles.

What makes the game stand out is not its story, but its razor-sharp gameplay and brilliantly crafted level design. Each stage is a gauntlet of saw blades, spikes, and deadly traps that require flawless timing, precise jumps, and lightning-fast reflexes.\nPerfectly Tuned Controls #The controls are incredibly responsive, allowing you to make split-second adjustments as you navigate increasingly complex challenges. This game has one of the best controls I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, and it is really something the devs needed to nail perfectly because of the nature of the insane difficulty level. Death comes often, sometimes hundreds of times in a single level, but the game’s instant respawn system ensures the action never slows down, turning failure into a natural part of the learning curve rather than a punishment. So there is definitely some level of frustration to be had here, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be as rewarding, and fair, as it is challenging.\nPersonality And Replayability #Beyond its core mechanics, the game oozes personality, the pixel-art visuals strike a perfect balance between cute and grotesque, while the energetic soundtrack keeps adrenaline levels high, truly one of the best gaming OSTs in my opinion. Unlockable characters, hidden warp zones, and secret levels add depth and replayability, encouraging you to push their skills even further.

It’s a masterclass in precision platforming and remains one of the defining titles of the indie boom of the late 2000s and early 2010s. This is truly one of the best games of all time, and best indie games of all time, it even appeared as one of the main games in the documentary called \u0026ldquo;Indie Game The Movie\u0026rdquo; from 2012, which I highly recommend if you like indie videogames to any extent.

The game leans heavily on nostalgic influences like The Goonies and Stranger Things, blending retro homages with a coming-of-age adventure, and was the selling point for me, but I stayed because of the amazing story, gameplay and especially, the characters.\nStellar Retro Presentation #Visually, it shines with colorful 16-bit pixel art and VHS-style animated cutscenes that capture the spirit of the era. Its synth-driven soundtrack is equally strong, delivering an authentic retro feel that keeps the atmosphere engaging. The presentation is undoubtedly its greatest strength, if you are a fan of pixel-art than this game is one of the best you can find, the animations and art is incredible.\nCharming but Shallow Story #Gameplay mixes beat ’em up combat, light puzzles, platforming, and boss fights, each of the five playable characters has unique abilities, and switching between them is essential for progress.

These encounters are epic in scale, demanding patience and careful timing to overcome, somewhat like the Soulslike sub-genre titles. Between battles, exploration offers a slower pace, with vast landscapes to traverse, though some people may find these sections sparse or repetitive I quite like them since it helps out to balance the pacing of the frantic boss battles.\nSimple Yet Memorable #Combat is deliberately simple, with light and heavy attacks, dodges, and a few divine powers.

Themes of American exceptionalism, racism, religion, and the illusion of choice run throughout, culminating in a bold and divisive ending that sparked extensive debate. I highly recommend this title is absolutely not skipped if you like experiences which goes beyond what you watched on-screen.\nEnduring Legacy #Even today you can find people that likes to discuss this game\u0026rsquo;s ending, similar to how revolutionary the story from the first title was (would you kindly), it is truly one of the best aspects of the Bioshock frachise in my opinion, even though the gameplay is also amazing. Though the combat can at times feel repetitive and overshadowed by the weight of its story, the overall experience remains unforgettable. A mix of artistry, atmosphere, and philosophical depth, BioShock Infinite is still regarded as one of the most memorable games of its era, and really on of the best shooters you can experience.\n","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bioshock-infinite/","section":"Posts","summary":"This BioShock entry is a FPS that combines fast-paced combat with one of the most ambitious narratives in gaming.","title":"BioShock Infinite"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nRetro Run-and-Gun Revival #This game is a love letter to classic run-and-gun shooters like Contra and Metal Slug. Developed by Brazilian studio JoyMasher (which I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of), it delivers fast-paced side-scrolling action with tight controls, challenging enemy patterns, and explosive boss fights. The game’s retro-styled pixel art and chiptune-inspired soundtrack capture the look and feel of the 16-bit era while adding modern polish. The OST of this game is brilliant, same level as the classics that inspired it, and I\u0026rsquo;m really not exaggerating.\nFast, Cooperative Chaos #The gameplay emphasizes quick reflexes, varied weapon choices, and cooperative play, with both local coop and unlockable characters adding replay value. Fortunately I could experience the coop with a friend, though he lost interest once we beat this the first time, even though there were new playable characters afterwards. Though I highly recommend replaying with them since they change the gameplay a lot. Difficulty levels range from approachable to hardcore, making it accessible for newcomers while still satisfying genre veterans.\nShort but Impactful #On the downside, the campaign is short, with only six stages that can be finished in just a few hours. Some critics also noted that the game leans heavily on nostalgia without bringing many new ideas to the genre. In hectic moments, the screen can feel cluttered, occasionally making it hard to follow the action. Overall, Blazing Chrome succeeds as a faithful homage to its inspirations. This is a must-play for fans of the run-and-gun genre, or even just for the nostalgia alone, and finally I also highly recommend looking into the other JoyMasher titles, they are very high quality retro love letters.\n","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/blazing-chrome/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game is a love letter to classic run-and-gun shooters like Contra and Metal Slug.","title":"Blazing Chrome"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 65 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nA Fallen Kingdom #This videogame is one of the most acclaimed indie games of its era, a shining example of how atmosphere, challenge, and exploration can come together in near-perfect harmony. Developed by Team Cherry, this Metroidvania plunges you into the subterranean kingdom of Hallownest, a vast and decaying world filled with secrets, danger, and forgotten history. Its hand-drawn art style and fluid animation give each cavern, ruin, and character a unique personality, while the haunting orchestral soundtrack enhances the sense of melancholy beauty that permeates every corner of the game.\nPrecision And Exploration #Gameplay is centered on tight, responsive combat and gradual exploration. Armed with a simple nail weapon, you fight hordes of insect-like foes and formidable bosses that demand both skill and patience. Progression comes through discovering abilities, such as wall-climbing, dashes, and spells, that not only improve combat but also open up new paths, rewarding curiosity and persistence. This game does not implement a lot of new ideas when it comes to the foundations of it\u0026rsquo;s genre, but the level of quality of the execution is what makes it standout so much that it even makes you feel like this is really reinventing the whole thing.\nMystery And Atmosphere #Not to mention, at the sam time, it drinks a little bit of the fountain of the Soulslike genre. What sets Hollow Knight apart is its masterful use of atmosphere and storytelling. The narrative is told subtly through environmental details, cryptic dialogue, and fragments of lore, letting players uncover the tragic fall of Hallownest in their own way. This sense of mystery, combined with the game’s challenging but fair difficulty, creates a deeply engaging experience that keeps you pushing forward even through moments of frustration.\nPerfectly Balanced Challenge #Some people may consider this game somewhat hard because of the little Soulslike influence, but in my opinion the difficulty level is practically perfect, it is the most balanced game that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced, since there are a lot of builds you can mix and match different perks for specific challenges, it is truly a very flexible and complex combat system, even though it looks simplistic at first.\nEnduring Indie Legacy #Though it can be demanding, especially for those unaccustomed to difficult action-platformers, the payoff is immense. With its generous amount of content, hidden areas, and optional bosses, Hollow Knight offers dozens of hours of exploration and mastery. Its success has left a lasting mark on the indie scene, raising the bar for Metroidvanias and leaving fans eagerly awaiting its sequel, Silksong.\nA Once-In-Lifetime Game #I highly recommend playing this game to the fullest, enjoy absolutely all of it\u0026rsquo;s contents, go 100% go wild, it\u0026rsquo;ll be one of the best gaming experiences you can provide for yourself. I tried to finish this entirely, playing the DLCs and the hidden secret contents, but unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;m not skilled enough and I admit that I could never beat the optional boss-rush content, and face the secret boss, which is the considered the hardest one (no spoilers). Overall, this is one of those games that you wished your memory was erased so you can play it all over again for the first time, multiple times, truly one of the best games of all time and a must-play for literally everybody, not just fans of similar titles.\n","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/hollow-knight/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the most acclaimed indies, an example of atmosphere, challenge, and exploration coming together in harmony.","title":"Hollow Knight"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 9 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nCinematic Roman Spectacle #This title is a visually impressive action-adventure game set in an alternate version of ancient Rome.

The linear level design limits exploration, and the game often prioritizes spectacle over player choice, leading to a predictable experience for some.\nVisually Driven Experience #The narrative attempts to provide emotional depth to Marius’ journey, but historical liberties and a somewhat formulaic storyline reduce its impact. Nonetheless, some people appreciate the character-driven moments and the effort to weave a personal story amid large-scale battles.

The world of Cvstodia is beautifully grotesque, filled with striking character designs, memorable bosses, and lore that feels both mysterious and oppressive. Its soundtrack and sound design enhance the eerie, oppressive tone, making exploration a captivating experience.\nStyle Over Mechanics #And while the Soulslike Metroidvania sub-genre is very saturated nowadays, this title still manages to standout by it\u0026rsquo;s artistic style, visuals and unique cultural setting. Where the game falters is in its mechanics, combat, while serviceable, can feel clunky and repetitive, relying heavily on basic attacks with limited depth. This is understandable in my opinion since this is the very first entry to this series, and a bold attempt, I recommend playing the second title if you think that complex combat is a must in these kinds of games.\nAtmosphere Above All #The level design leans into heavy backtracking, which can become tedious despite the strong visual presentation. Despite these flaws, Blasphemous shines as an artistic achievement, delivering a unique and unsettling vision rarely seen in the genre. If you value atmosphere, lore, and striking visuals over perfectly polished gameplay, it’s a memorable and worthwhile experience. It is one of the best of it\u0026rsquo;s kind in my opinion, I admit that what made me play this game was the visuals, but I stayed because the gameplay was also very high quality, I consider it a must-play for fans of Soulslike Metroidvanias.\n","date":"28 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/blasphemous/","section":"Posts","summary":"The first Blasphemous is a dark, atmospheric Metroidvania that stands out for its haunting pixel art.","title":"Blasphemous"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 30 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nModern Metroidvania Successor #The first Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a spiritual successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night that delivers a faithful and engaging Metroidvania experience. The exploration is well-paced, the castle layout is intricate and rewarding, and the shard system adds a layer of creativity and customization that keeps combat fresh. Combined with varied weapons, spells, and the ability to swap loadouts quickly, the gameplay feels both deep and flexible.\nGothic Roots Revived #The presentation leans heavily into gothic atmosphere, with moody environments and a strong soundtrack composed by Michiru Yamane, which elevates the experience and ties it back to its Castlevania roots. This is truly one of it\u0026rsquo;s standouts, the same people that worked in the original SOTN was developing this, and for fans of this genre this was enough to be interested. Visuals are stylish, though some players found the character models and mix of art styles inconsistent compared to the initial Kickstarter promise.\nCombat Over Story #While the gameplay is polished, the story and characters are largely serviceable rather than memorable, often acting as a backdrop for the action rather than a driving force. As already said, the focus here is in the combat, and while the previous games of this genre already had very complex and fun combat mechanics, this one showed us what the original developers are able to achieve.\nBuild Freedom Rewarded #It is impressive the amount of builds you can think of while playing this, even the \u0026ldquo;funny\u0026rdquo; ones such as the Luck-based builds are viable, so you are in for a treat if you like that kind of thing.

I\u0026rsquo;m glad I never played this back in the day, because I would never enjoy the experience of not understanding the story because of the language barrier. So I ended up emulating the SNES version a few years ago, though I recommend getting the more recent versions instead, they are some good QOL improvements that are very worth having.\nMasterful Time-Travel Tale #Chrono Trigger is, without a doubt, one of the greatest video games ever made, arguably the best of all time. From the moment you begin, the game’s masterful storytelling immediately captivates you, weaving an intricate time-traveling narrative that spans prehistoric eras, futuristic cities, and apocalyptic futures. Every character feels alive, with distinct personalities, motivations, and arcs that make you genuinely care about their journey. In my opinion, the characters are the actual standout, even though the story is the best aspect, the main cast is really the ones that carry the plot, on an insane level of charisma.\nMusic, Choices, Combat #Not to mention their music themes, and the OST is simple one of the best, if not the best, out of all games that I\u0026rsquo;ve played, it is one of those that you save the songs to listen as a playlist, similar to Undertale or Deltarune ones too. The multiple endings give the story incredible depth and replay value, allowing each choice to leave a meaningful impact on the world. Its battle system, a revolutionary take on the active-time combat mechanic, is both strategic and fluid, with the innovative combination attacks between party members adding layers of tactical brilliance.\nSimple Yet Satisfying Combat #At first the combat may seem very simplistic, and even though it is not a very challenging game, it still manages to make the combat a very pleasant experience, with insane levels of damage combos, though don\u0026rsquo;t expect a complex system such as traditional JRPG classes and equipment combinations, this is more of an adventure title dressed as a JRPG. If you think that a complex battle system is a must, such as ones seen in Chrono Cross for example, than this title won\u0026rsquo;t appeal to you at all.\nTimeless Artistry #The visuals, crafted with charming 16-bit sprites by Akira Toriyama, remain timeless, giving each location a unique and unforgettable personality. Meanwhile, Yasunori Mitsuda’s and Nobuo Uematsu’s score is nothing short of iconic, perfectly conveying the game’s sense of adventure, wonder, and emotional weight. Even decades after its release, Chrono Trigger stands as a flawless example of what a video game can achieve, blending narrative, gameplay, music, and design into a singular, transcendent experience.\nPerfection in Game Form #And while I admit that Final Fantasy VII was the one that made videogame become real art, outside the videogame bubble at the time, in my opinion, Chrono Trigger is the most advanced game on this regard. It\u0026rsquo;s charm alone carries a heavy weight, not just from the nostalgic point of view (not to mention I\u0026rsquo;ve never played this back in the day anyway). For anyone who appreciates the art of gaming, it is not just a classic, it is perfection.\n","date":"28 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/chrono-trigger/","section":"Posts","summary":"The best game of all time, in my opinion, and it lives forever in my heart as the experience I wished the most I could forget.","title":"Chrono Trigger"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 5 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCultural Journey Begins #This videogame is an indie puzzle-platformer, the MC is called Nuna, a young girl, and her arctic fox companion as they journey through harsh blizzards and myth-inspired landscapes to save their community. The game is notable for its cultural authenticity, blending gameplay with short documentary-style “Cultural Insights” that explore Iñupiat traditions, stories, and ways of life.\nInteractive Folktale Presentation #Visually, the game stands out with its minimalist yet haunting art style and narration in the Iñupiaq language, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack. This creates an experience that feels less like a typical platformer and more like an interactive folktale. The partnership with Alaska Native elders and storytellers elevates it into a meaningful cultural work rather than just entertainment.\nGameplay Limitations #However, the gameplay itself is often seen as the weakest part. While the mechanics of switching between Nuna and the fox add variety, controls can feel imprecise and the AI occasionally struggles in single-player. Platforming sequences are sometimes frustrating, with trial-and-error sections and floaty movement that detract from the story’s flow.\nHeartfelt Cultural Impact #Despite these flaws, this title has been widely praised for its heart and impact, earning awards such as BAFTA’s Best Debut Game and recognition from Games for Change. It is best approached as a cultural and narrative experience first, and a platformer second, short but memorable, and particularly rewarding for those interested in indigenous storytelling through games.

Set in a reimagined late 1500s Japan, it blends swordplay, stealth, and vertical movement to create a fluid and tense gameplay experience. It may not sound like a very original game at first, but each and every mechanic is so masterfully implemented that it sets itself apart, and by a big difference, from any previous implementation with similar ideas.\nPosture-Driven Combat #The game’s defining feature is its posture system, which forces precise parrying and timing rather than relying on stamina management. Though don\u0026rsquo;t mistake this for how stamina works on Soulslike games at all, they are completely different mechanics. This makes every duel feel like a high-stakes test of reflexes. Stealth and traversal add flexibility, but combat mastery is essential, especially against its many punishing bosses. I love stealth in videogames, and this one was no different, even though it is has very simple mechanics on this regard.\nBrutal Beauty #Visually, the game is stunning, with rich environments ranging from serene temples to grotesque battlefields, all tied together by atmospheric sound design. The resurrection mechanic also introduces unique strategic choices, letting players push risks further. While its difficulty can be overwhelming and weapon variety is limited compared to other FromSoftware titles, Sekiro delivers one of the most rewarding single-player experiences of its generation. I consider this one of the best games of all time, but that is because I\u0026rsquo;m a die-hard Soulslike fan, to the point that I wished I could forget everything about this game, so I can play it again for the first time, there is no excuse to skip this one.\nA Singular Experience #And I wished we had more games similar to this one, less focused on the complex RPG mechanics and builds, and implement more platforming and stealth mechanics instead, creating more unique experiences.

Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a younger, less experienced Batman facing assassins hired by Black Mask, while also exploring his first encounters with iconic villains like the Joker. On the plus side, the game retains the core Arkham formula, fluid combat, stealth predator encounters, and a sprawling Gotham to explore.\nMemorable Yet Repetitive #The story offers an interesting look at Batman’s early career, and the boss fights (especially Deathstroke) are among the series’ most memorable ones. However, it’s often considered the weakest entry: it reuses many assets from Arkham City, introduces few real innovations. The open world feels emptier compared to its predecessors, and some pacing drags.\nSolid but Skippable #No big news when it comes to how the game works, which is a huge step down when compared to Arkham City, which had an amazing open world experience. Overall, a solid but unremarkable entry, worth playing for fans of the Arkham series and Batman’s lore, but it doesn’t reach the polish and impact of Arkham Asylum or City.

What makes it stand out is its innovative control scheme: you guide both siblings simultaneously, each mapped to one side of the controller. This mechanic is more than a gimmick, it ties directly into the game’s themes of cooperation, family, and loss, making the gameplay itself part of the storytelling. Visually, the game presents a beautiful, fairy tale-like world filled with both wonder and danger.\nAtmospheric Visual Storytelling #I particularly love the aesthetics of it, and I confess this was more of a standout to me than the unique control mechanics, at least at first. Its environments are varied and atmospheric, supported by a moving orchestral score that enhances the emotional weight of the journey. The story is told without traditional dialogue, relying instead on gestures, tone, and environmental cues, which makes its impact even more universal. And I enjoyed this very much, it really makes you pay especial attention to what is happening, not that the story is particularly complex though.\nShort, Lasting Impact #The game is short, lasting around three hours, but this brevity works in its favor, it delivers a focused, emotionally powerful narrative without unnecessary filler. Some people may find the controls tricky at first, but most adapt quickly, and the payoff is worth the effort.

Set in the bleak and mysterious land of Lordran, the game offers you little guidance, pushing them to learn through trial, error, and careful observation. This style of exploration is not for everybody, though if you are willing to learn how to handle it, and how unique it is, then you are in for a great experience on this regard.\nInterconnected World Design #Its interconnected level design is one of its greatest strengths, with cleverly hidden shortcuts, looping paths, and secret areas that reward curiosity and persistence. This is truly one of it\u0026rsquo;s biggest standouts, the entire world is interconnected, it feels more realistic, but it also has the drawback of having a lot of empty space between locations. The atmosphere is thick with a sense of decay and melancholy, supported by cryptic lore that invites you to piece together the story from item descriptions and environmental details.\nDeliberate Brutal Combat #Combat is slow, precise, and unforgiving, demanding patience, timing, and mastery over every encounter, and since this was one of the first \u0026ldquo;Soulslike\u0026rdquo; implementations, it feels very dated and clunky for today\u0026rsquo;s standards. Boss battles stand out as monumental challenges, often feeling overwhelming at first but immensely satisfying once conquered, and while some of them had some tricks to make the fight easier (similar to some Demon\u0026rsquo;s Souls bosses) the vast majority of them are purely skill-based.\nAsynchronous Online World #The online features, such as player messages, co-op summoning, and PvP invasions, further enhance the experience by making Lordran feel alive and unpredictable. Particularly I didn\u0026rsquo;t cared much for the online experience, so I turned that off because I really hated when somebody invaded my game and I had to fight them, though I admit that this is a very unique implementation for this kind of experience.\nFlawed PC Port #The PC port, however, was widely criticized upon release for poor optimization, locked resolution, and awkward controls without mods like DSFix, which became almost essential for a smooth experience. And even though all of this was improved on new re-releases of this title, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the OG release here, so if you, for some reason, are still playing this, I still recommend using these old methods to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the majority of the port problems.\nGenre-Defining Legacy #Even so, the core gameplay was so compelling that many overlooked the technical shortcomings. Despite its rough edges, the game’s influence is undeniable, it popularized the “Soulslike” formula and inspired countless successors, and made me a big fan of this genre, to the point that I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself playing any action RPG nowadays if it isn\u0026rsquo;t a Soulslike one, the old mouse-based ones such as Diablo are no longer appealing to me. For those willing to endure its steep learning curve and initial frustrations, Dark Souls delivers a uniquely immersive and unforgettable journey, and I also highly recommend playing the DLCs and secret areas.\n","date":"27 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/dark-souls/","section":"Posts","summary":"A punishing yet rewarding action RPG that reshaped the way difficulty and exploration are handled in modern games.","title":"Dark Souls"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 6 hours ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)\nNostalgic Evolution Concept #The first Evoland entry is a charming indie action-RPG that takes players on a nostalgic journey through the evolution of video games.

This is especially nostalgic for me, since I lived through the RPG evolution era, at least from 16-bit an onwards, so I\u0026rsquo;m a little biased.\nClassic RPG Homage #The gameplay is a playful homage to classic RPGs, including The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Secret of Mana.

This constant genre-shifting keeps the experience fresh, though it can sometimes feel jarring for players who prefer a more consistent style. It is amazing how well it transitions between the genres, you can even sometimes play a bullet-hell, and the a couple of moments later, you are playing a turn-based RPG, there are very few games which tries to implement this, and I find this awesome.\nCreative Retro Tribute #Some people have praised the game for its creativity, inventive approach, and homage to gaming history.

So not a very unique story to begin with, though I consider it was very well executed, at the very least. Exploration and puzzle-solving are key components, and the non-linear, Metroidvania-like structure encourages players to uncover secrets and upgrades across different realms. This game won\u0026rsquo;t appeal to fans of metroidvanias, but it definitely drinks from the same fountain as those.\nTactical Fragile Combat #Combat is tactical and timing-focused, with all weapons and shields breaking after use, forcing the player to adapt and manage resources carefully. While some people find the controls slightly clunky and combat repetitive at times, the gameplay’s challenge adds to its rewarding feel. This is somewhat similar to something like the soulslikes titles, though, again, this title has a very light dose on those aspects, similar to the metroidvanias appeal.\nAtmosphere and Impact #The soundtrack and atmospheric design complement the visuals perfectly, immersing you in a mythic world that feels alive.

Its combination of striking art, myth-inspired exploration, and strategic combat makes it a standout experience for fans of action-platformers and mythology.\n","date":"26 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/apotheon/","section":"Posts","summary":"A 2D action‑platformer, it stands out for its unique visual style, inspired by ancient Greek black‑figure pottery.","title":"Apotheon"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 30 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nStylish Combat Mastery #The 5th Devil May Cry entry is a stylish return to form for the series, delivering some of the most satisfying Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash combat in the genre. The three playable characters, Nero, Dante, and the newcomer \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;. Each bring unique mechanics that keep gameplay fresh, with Nero’s Devil Breakers adding variety, Dante’s deep style system offering unmatched versatility, and V’s pet-based combat introducing a slower but tactical option. Particularly I was not a fan of V, but once you get the hang of him you fall in love with his playstyle, Capcom really is amazingly creative when creating unique characters such as those.\nRE Engine Spectacle #Visually, the game shines thanks to Capcom’s RE Engine, boasting detailed character models, flashy effects, and smooth performance on PC. This shows how amazing and flexible the engine can be, creating gruesome survival horror titles such as the RE Remakes (and also the first-person ones) and also intense action games such as DMC. Boss fights are a highlight, combining cinematic spectacle with challenging mechanics, while the soundtrack complements the action with energetic flair, so no big news here, this is still \u0026ldquo;Devil May Cry\u0026rdquo;-level of quality.\nFlawed Yet Essential #On the downside, the level design is often repetitive, with corridors and arenas that feel less inspired compared to the combat itself, though particularly I was never a big an of the exploration on this franchise anyway, so not a big deal for me. The story, though serviceable and filled with fan-pleasing moments, leans heavily into cheesy dialogue and can feel thin for newcomers. Some gameplay quirks, like limited camera control and the restrictive Devil Breaker system, also drew criticism. Overall, Devil May Cry 5 is a thrilling, polished, and over-the-top action game. Its stylish combat and replayability far outweigh its flaws, making it a must-play for fans of fast-paced action and anyone seeking a modern Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash experience.\n","date":"26 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/devil-may-cry-5/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stylish return to form for the series, delivering some of the most satisfying Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash combat in the genre.","title":"Devil May Cry 5"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 80 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nWasteland and Systems #The 4th Fallout entry is a sprawling open-world RPG that drops players into a post-apocalyptic Boston, offering a vast wasteland to explore filled with factions, mutants, and secrets. The game shines with its deep crafting and settlement-building mechanics, giving players a tangible way to shape their world, alongside a solid shooting system that improves over previous entries. Though particularly speaking, I was not quite a fan of the settlement mechanics, so I tried very hard to skip them as much as possible.\nExploration Over Story #While the main story is serviceable, it often feels overshadowed by side quests and exploration, which are where the game truly excels, so no big news here, this is also the case for most of the previous Fallout entries. Graphically, it’s a mixed bag, some areas are impressively detailed, while others feel dated or buggy. Mods on PC greatly enhance both visuals and gameplay, extending replayability, and the modding community is still strong up to this day. Overall, Fallout 4 is a rewarding experience for those who enjoy exploration, player-driven storytelling, and creative freedom.\nCompanions and Character #This game also places a stronger emphasis on companions, each with their own personalities, moral alignments, and personal quests. Traveling with characters like Nick Valentine or Piper adds emotional weight to the journey, as their commentary and reactions help bring the Commonwealth to life. These companions aren’t just combat support, they often reflect the game’s broader themes and provide some of its most engaging narrative moments, especially when their individual stories unfold over time. Though they for sure don\u0026rsquo;t have the same level of depth when compared to previous entries in the series.\nFactions and Choices #The faction system further expands player choice, presenting multiple groups with conflicting ideologies and goals. None of them will win you over though, the world building is not as rich as something like New Vegas. Aligning with factions such as the Brotherhood of Steel, the Railroad, or the Institute shapes not only the outcome of the main story but also how the world responds to your actions. While these choices don’t always feel as nuanced or reactive as in earlier Fallout titles, they still offer meaningful role-playing opportunities and encourage multiple playthroughs to see different perspectives.\nAtmosphere and Longevity #Meanwhile, the returning retro-futuristic radio soundtrack perfectly complements the setting, balancing bleak themes with moments of dark humor and nostalgia that the series is known for. Despite its reliance on familiar Bethesda design conventions, this Fallout entry succeeds in creating a world that feels alive and worth getting lost in. Whether scavenging for scrap, uncovering hidden locations, or stumbling into unexpected encounters, the game consistently rewards curiosity. Even years after its release, the Commonwealth remains an engaging playground for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series.\n","date":"26 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/fallout-4/","section":"Posts","summary":"This title is a sprawling open-world RPG that drops you into a post-apocalyptic Boston.","title":"Fallout 4"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nEpisodic Horror Mystery #This title is a dark, episodic indie adventure game, the MC is called Sal Fisher, a boy with a prosthetic face mask who moves into a new apartment complex and quickly becomes involved in a murder mystery.

Over five episodes, the game shifts from eerie slice-of-life exploration into psychological and supernatural horror, weaving a narrative that balances emotional depth with disturbing imagery.\nNightmarish Atmosphere #The game’s strongest point is its atmosphere, its hand-drawn art style mixes colorful cartoonish visuals with grotesque and surreal moments, creating a mood that feels both innocent and nightmarish. The soundtrack, combines ambient soundscapes with moody rock and synth elements, adding a haunting quality that stays with you long after playing.\nSimple Yet Clever Gameplay #Gameplay is straightforward, mostly involving exploration, dialogue, and puzzle solving. While some puzzles are clever, others can feel obscure and require careful note-taking.

The playable characters don\u0026rsquo;t have any particular difference other than the looks, so it is not like a hero shooter or anything like that.\nDynamic AI Director #What makes the game stand out is its AI Director, an adaptive system that changes enemy spawns, item placement, and pacing on the fly, ensuring that no two playthroughs feel exactly the same. Yet again Valve was able to create something new among tons of similar games at the time, while at the same time, shaping the future of the online coop shooters at the time, and even up to today\u0026rsquo;s standards.\nTeamwork-Driven Gameplay #The gameplay is simple but incredibly effective: stick with your team, manage limited resources, and fight through waves of common infected, alongside powerful special zombies that force coordination. The game thrives in multiplayer, delivering chaotic, adrenaline-pumping moments where cooperation is the difference between survival and failure, I advise playing this with some friends, it\u0026rsquo;ll be a much more enjoyable experience\nEnduring Co-Op Legacy #Unfortunately I never experience this game online, but I had a really good time playing this as a single-player title, I could only play online when the second title launched. While its single-player mode is more limited and the overall content isn’t vast, the sheer replayability, intense atmosphere, and focus on cooperative play made Left 4 Dead a landmark in online shooters.

III. This change was due to the Dead Space popularity at the time, similar to what Capcom did with Resident Evil and Call of Duty back in the day, making RE more action-focused to try and make it more popular since COD was becoming big.\nHuman-Centered Storytelling #The story leans heavily on Jim’s personal life and video messages exchanged with his family back home, giving the game a more grounded, human touch compared to the bombastic style of its predecessors. And although the previous games had very little focus on the story, it was still an enjoyable experience Capcom was never known by complex and unique game lore anyway, so nobody expected much out of them on this regard.\nSlower Survival Gameplay #Gameplay mixes third-person shooting with exploration in Jim’s massive utility Rig, which feels weighty and practical rather than like a pure combat mech. It really felt like you were playing a spin-off of Dead Space at this point. The frigid environments and dangerous Akrid creatures create a tense survival atmosphere, though missions often boil down to repetitive shootouts and fetch quests. The combat system itself, now more cover-based (another trait of the time due to Gears of War), is serviceable but lacks the distinct flair of earlier entries.\nAmbitious Yet Average #Where Lost Planet 3 shines is in its world-building and narrative tone, which deliver a sense of isolation and corporate exploitation wrapped in a personal story. So I got to admit that, even for Capcom\u0026rsquo;s standards, the characters are very good on this one. Unfortunately, uneven pacing and dated mechanics prevent it from fully realizing its potential. It’s an interesting but divisive entry, more of a sci-fi survival drama than the high-octane action fans might expect.

The game’s story is compelling, driven by morally complex choices that shape its ending, while its characters are surprisingly well-developed for the genre.\nTactical Stealth Combat #Combat is tense and deliberate, rewarding careful planning and resource management, though the game still allows for more action-oriented playstyles. And although using a \u0026ldquo;stealth x non-stealth\u0026rdquo; shooter approach at the time was becoming old by the time of this release, this one is masterfully implemented.

While linear in design, the tightly crafted levels and atmospheric storytelling make it a standout experience, particularly for people who appreciate a gripping narrative combined with moments of genuine fear and suspense.

Making the combat look like a precise resource management dance, even more so than the regular Dark Souls games, and with more flashy visuals. Mastering these mechanics feels rewarding, and boss fights are intense and memorable.\nDiablo-Style Loot #The loot system, however, is heavily inspired by Diablo-style RPGs, meaning lots of gear drops that can feel repetitive or overwhelming. Particularly I really hate this kind of approach, it makes everything look generic unoriginal, fortunately you can re-skin any armor and weapon into other ones that you already found through the game.

The level design emphasizes constant fighting over any meaningful narrative or variety, which made it hard for me to stay engaged. The sheer volume of enemies and chaotic encounters felt more exhausting than exciting, and the game didn’t offer enough moments to catch a breath or feel a sense of progression.\nA Mid Entry #Despite the game’s nods to classic FPS mechanics, I couldn’t get past the first six hours, as the repetitive action and lack of depth made it hard to maintain interest. Overall, Serious Sam 3: BFE may appeal to fans of relentless, old-school shooters, but for me, it fell short of sustaining engagement, leaving the experience more tiring than enjoyable.

The gameplay blends puzzle-platforming with inventive boss battles that often require both skill and problem-solving, keeping the action fresh and engaging throughout. It is not a particularly challenging game for people used to this genre, but I can see people not familiar with this having a hard time.\nEmotionally Driven Narrative #The story, which touches on themes of religion, authority, and personal identity, was seen as one of the game’s strongest aspects. Many people highlighted how emotionally grounded the characters felt and how the narrative added weight to the otherwise light-hearted visual style. That said, some players and critics felt that the dialogue could be overly long or heavy-handed, slowing the pacing at times, so keep this in mind if you are not a fan of dialog-heavy titles.\nLinear Yet Rewarding Design #Mechanically, the game offers tight platforming and enjoyable progression, though it is more linear than most Metroidvania titles. It\u0026rsquo;s exploration is one of the most satisfying ones that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, not at the same level of something like SOTN, but it gets close enough by it\u0026rsquo;s scope. The “Tweak” upgrade system was considered underdeveloped by some, since it provided only modest gameplay variety and broke easily in combat. Similarly, combat itself was sometimes criticized for feeling imprecise compared to the game’s excellent puzzles and exploration sequences, overall these mechanics are not bad, but due to it\u0026rsquo;s indie nature, they are indeed more limited.\nArtistic Indie Standout #Overall, Iconoclasts was celebrated as a standout indie release of 2018, while not perfect in terms of depth or exploration, it impressed with its artistry, memorable story, and clever design. It is a memorable experience through all of it\u0026rsquo;s features, mechanics and all the idea it is trying to convey, there is no aspect I can think of that is not very well implemented.

It sometimes feel like you are playing a side-scroller version of Hotline Miami since it is a hit-kill game with high difficulty levels.\nHypnotic Neon Atmosphere #The game’s trial-and-error structure makes every level feel like a carefully choreographed dance of reflexes and precision.

And while I\u0026rsquo;m very biased since I love synthwave, I can safely say that this is one of the best aspects of the game even for people that are not familiar with this aesthetic and/or music genre.\nFragmented Psychological Narrative #Beyond the action, the narrative dives into psychological themes, using fragmented storytelling and surreal conversations that keep you guessing. While the story is engaging, it deliberately leaves some questions unanswered, which can feel frustrating but also adds to its mysterious allure.

Its soundtrack is a highlight, shifting seamlessly alongside the visuals between eras and giving each area a memorable energy.

It serves as a love letter to classic NES Castlevania games, particularly Castlevania III, with its 8-bit visuals, gothic atmosphere, and deliberate platforming. It even has some of the same creators of the original classic Castlevania titles making this game, so you know that you are in for an amazing experience.\nStrategic Character Switching #The MC is called Zangetsu, a demon slayer who can recruit other characters along the way, including Miriam, Alfred, and Gebel, which are all playable. Each character has distinct abilities that add strategic variety and allow for multiple ways to approach stages and bosses. Switching between them in real time is one of the game’s strongest mechanics, encouraging experimentation and tactical play. Not a very unique mechanic, for example, Trine has done this a very long time ago, but since the level design is very high quality, it makes it so that this mechanic is masterfully implemented.\nShort Yet Replayable #The game is short, often completable in just a couple of hours, but it makes up for that with branching paths, multiple endings, and several difficulty modes that reward replaying. I highly recommend doing 100% on this one, it is very rewarding and it was really meant to be played this way, the regular mainline quest is just half of it, but be aware that it\u0026rsquo;ll be a much more challenging playthrough. Its music and pixel art capture the spirit of late-80s action games, while subtle quality-of-life improvements prevent it from feeling dated, so if you are no a fan of this I recommend skipping this one.\nFaithful Gothic Action #While some people may find the controls stiff compared to modern platformers, the overall package delivers exactly what it promises: a polished, faithful homage to the golden age of side-scrolling gothic action. It’s a compact but memorable experience for fans of classic Castlevania or anyone looking for a nostalgic yet well-crafted challenge. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the Castlevania series and I consider this one of the best games that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, don\u0026rsquo;t skip it if you are into any of that to any extent.\n","date":"21 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/bloodstained-curse-of-the-moon/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is a retro-inspired action platformer created by Inti Creates as a companion project to Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.","title":"Bloodstained Curse of the Moon"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 190 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nExpanded Souls Formula #The second Dark Souls entry builds on the legacy of its predecessor by offering a massive, interconnected world filled with danger, mystery, and punishing combat. It stays true to the series’ core identity, every fight demands patience, precision, and a willingness to learn from failure. The game broadens character customization with a wide range of weapons, spells, and builds, making experimentation more rewarding than ever. Compared to the first Dark Souls, however, its world design feels less tightly woven, with areas that sometimes lack the same sense of cohesion and atmosphere.\nFragmented World Design #You can never interconnect the worlds, physically, making it a much less immersive one compared to the first one which felt like a real place, since the entirety of the world was connected in some way. The large number of bosses adds variety, but many are less memorable than the iconic encounters of the original, especially because there are a lot of reskins and reuse of the same bosses, making if feel like an old SNES-era title, which devs simply changed the enemy color, changed it\u0026rsquo;s name and called it a new thing entirely.\nDivisive Yet Rewarding #Still, the game shines in its oppressive mood, haunting environments, and the thrill of overcoming seemingly impossible odds. While it may be divisive among fans, Dark Souls II remains a challenging and deeply satisfying entry in the series, rewarding those willing to endure its trials. Particularly speaking I hated this one from start to finish, until I learned how to master it\u0026rsquo;s differences compared to the first title, then I started loving this one as much as I loved all the other Dark Souls entries up until that point.\nDefinitive Editions Essential #This title is much more enjoyable if you play the enhanced versions of it, which I unfortunately never experienced, they are much more challenging and add more content while also shifting enemy placement/count in the world. Another unskippable content are the DLCs, in my opinion they are a standout, introducing new contents entirely, from enemies, spells, weapons and even fun little mechanics here and there when it comes to exploration. I highly recommend not skipping this one if you enjoy Dark Souls to any extent, just keep in mind this is a game that is focused much more in the adventure aspect, instead of the combat-focused RPG elements of the previous titles such as Demon\u0026rsquo;s Souls and Dark Souls.\n","date":"21 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/dark-souls-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"Building on its predecessor by offering an interconnected world filled with danger, mystery, and punishing combat.","title":"Dark Souls II"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 4 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nWordless Emotional Journey #This game is a visually stunning and emotionally charged indie platformer, It tells the story of a young woman navigating grief, expressed through a wordless journey across surreal, watercolor landscapes that evolve as she regains strength and abilities. There isn\u0026rsquo;t really much of a plot going on, it is a much more artistic game, more than a regular traditional one that has a mainline story and characters, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect much on this regard.\nArt, Music, Mechanics #The game stands out for its breathtaking hand-drawn art and fluid animations, paired with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that reacts dynamically to the player’s progress. Each area introduces new mechanics, such as turning heavy to resist winds or gliding gracefully, all woven seamlessly into the theme of emotional recovery. The puzzles and platforming in general aren\u0026rsquo;t much of a challenge, though this is really not the point this game is trying to make.\nAtmospheric Gameplay Focus #The gameplay is simple and accessible, focusing more on atmosphere and exploration than challenge. There are no enemies, death screens, or complex systems, just gentle platforming and puzzles that emphasize flow and immersion. This makes GRIS feel more like an interactive piece of art than a traditional game.\nReception and Recommendation #Some people have praised GRIS for its beauty, emotional resonance, and cohesive design, though some note its linearity and short playtime of around four to five hours. Still, for those seeking a meditative and artistically rich experience, GRIS is regarded as one of the most memorable indie releases of its time.

The MC is called Jackie Estacado, who wields both firearms and demonic “Demon Arms” that allow for brutal executions and creative combat. The cel-shaded art direction stands out, giving the game a unique visual identity that complements its graphic novel roots. This is not the most unique and original art-style and story-telling, but it is masterfully executed, which is not an easy task.\nShort Intense Campaign #The story moves quickly, with a campaign that can be finished in under seven hours, offering a tightly scripted but intense ride. While the narrative has some emotional weight, it leans more into action and spectacle than the moody atmosphere of the first game. A cooperative “Vendetta” mode adds some replayability, though it lacks the depth and polish of the main story. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a much more enjoyable experience if you are familiar with the original media this story was told, which unfortunately for me, this was not the case, but I could perfectly enjoy the game, regardless of this fact.\nMemorable Yet Limited #On the downside, enemy AI can feel simplistic, and the linear level design leaves little room for exploration, this was a common trait of shooters at the time, so keep this in mind. Though, it still has a memorable story solely because of the main character, it is the one that carries the whole plot, not to mention (a little SPOILER here now) the game\u0026rsquo;s ending leaves you with a cliff-hanger, which is still unsolved up until this day since we still never got a sequel to this one. Some fans also felt that the shift from the original’s darker tone to a more arcade-like style was a step back in atmosphere. Still, the combat is thrilling, the presentation bold, and the experience memorable despite its brevity, one of the most unique shooters that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played.\n","date":"21 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/the-darkness-ii/","section":"Posts","summary":"A fast-paced FPS that blends traditional gunplay with supernatural powers in a stylish, comic-book inspired world.","title":"The Darkness II"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 18 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nFamiliar Cooperative Formula #The second Trine entry is a side-scrolling puzzle-platformer with a strong emphasis on cooperative play and physics-based mechanics. You control three interchangeable heroes, a knight, a thief, and a wizard, each with unique abilities that you combine to solve puzzles and fight enemies. The formula of this game hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed in the slightest when it comes to the first title, so if you liked the first one then there is little reason not to play this sequel.\nVisuals and Puzzle Design #The game stands out for its stunning visuals, with lush, fairy-tale environments and vibrant colors that still look impressive today. The puzzles strike a nice balance between creativity and accessibility, especially when played in co-op, though solo play can feel a bit repetitive over time. I unfortunately never played this one in coop, but I did enjoyed playing it as a single-player game, so I also recommend this for lone players. Combat is serviceable but secondary to the platforming and puzzle-solving.\nCharming Sequel Experience #Overall, Trine 2 is a polished, charming, and visually enchanting experience, best enjoyed with friends, it’s not particularly long or difficult, but it delivers a memorable, atmospheric adventure. Not much can be said about the story, but the game do try to at least start creating an universe of it\u0026rsquo;s own, and subsequent entries also do this, which is nice to see, though at this point it is still an excuse for a plot.

Instead of giving players weapons or combat options, it makes you completely defenseless, forcing you to run or hide from grotesque creatures that stalk the corridors of a decaying castle. This sense of vulnerability is amplified by the game’s sanity system: staying in darkness or witnessing horrifying events slowly unravels Daniel’s mind, distorting vision and sound to create an even more terrifying atmosphere.\nImmersive Dread Design #The physics-based interactions, like manually opening doors or pulling objects, help immerse you in its world, making every action feel more tactile and tense. This was a standout at the time this released, similar to the fist time the gaming industry experienced the Half-Life 2 features for physics-based mechanics. Coupled with haunting sound design, oppressive visuals, and clever environmental storytelling, Amnesia creates a suffocating sense of dread that few horror games have matched.\nLasting Horror Influence #This title is not for the weeks at heart, I consider myself very bullet-proof when it comes to scary titles, but this one got into my nerves, regardless. In my opinion it’s still considered one of the most influential horror games ever made, inspiring countless successors and streamers alike with its unique blend of helplessness and fear. This also helped popularize the \u0026ldquo;Lets Plays\u0026rdquo; YouTube videos at the time, which featured entire games being played, reacted and commented, in the video platform.

On the surface, it’s a precision platformer, the MC is called Madeline on her climb up the mysterious Celeste Mountain. The controls are simple, jump, dash, and climb, but the way these mechanics are layered creates an incredible amount of depth. Even though the formula is so simply that is even considered saturated nowadays, it is masterfully executed, proving that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to escalate game complexity in order to deliver an amazing gaming experience.\nChallenge With Meaning #Every level introduces new twists that keep the challenge fresh, and while it can be brutally difficult, it never feels unfair. Each failure is a lesson, and every success feels immensely rewarding. What makes Celeste truly special, though, is its emotional core, the game explores themes like anxiety, depression, and self-doubt in a way that’s sincere and relatable, giving the climb symbolic weight. I cannot related to the main point this game is trying to make since I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced any of that, but I can totally see this hitting hard if you have lived any of the mental issues this game is trying to convey.\nMechanical and Emotional Harmony #Madeline’s personal struggles mirror the obstacles the player faces, making progress feel both mechanical and emotional. This is reinforced by gorgeous pixel art and a phenomenal soundtrack, which shifts between tranquil and intense depending on the moment. This game really has almost zero to no flaws, the art, pacing, difficulty, level design and OST, it is simply one of the highest quality the gaming industry has every provided.\nA Human Ascent #Ultimately, this is more than just a tough platformer, it’s a deeply human story wrapped in clever design, it sets a new bar on videogame storytelling, I highly recommend not skipping this one if you like platformers to any extend. I also recommend trying to 100% it, but only if you like masochist-level of difficulty, though the little secrets here and there (like the Piko8 cartridges) are already enough for some people. Fun fact: this game was originally developed using the Piko8 game-engine, which was originally intended to be used as a prototyping engine.\n","date":"20 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/celeste/","section":"Posts","summary":"A standout indie platformer on PC that balances demanding gameplay with a surprisingly touching story.","title":"Celeste"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 15 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nAnimated Jazz Aesthetic #This game is a run-and-gun indie gem that immediately stands out thanks to its striking 1930s cartoon art style. Every frame is hand-drawn and paired with a lively jazz and ragtime soundtrack, making the game feel like you’re playing inside an old animated short. This level of craftsmanship gives it a unique identity that very few games have achieved, and this is especially awesome for people that lived this era in cartoon history, with characters such as the Disney ones from the Mickey universe.\nRelentless Boss Battles #As for the gameplay, it is focused on intense boss battles, sprinkled with some platforming stages. Each boss has multiple phases, with unpredictable and creative attacks that keep you on your toes. The controls are responsive and precise, which is crucial because the game is notoriously difficult. Success often comes after many failed attempts, making victories especially satisfying. While the formula is not particularly unique and original, it is masterfully executed, the bosses and stages are very memorable and you\u0026rsquo;ll for sure know what you are facing even after lots of subsequent plays.\nPunishing Skill Test #The difficulty, however, can be polarizing, some players will find the relentless challenge frustrating, while others will appreciate it as a test of patience and skill, particularly I enjoyed it\u0026rsquo;s hard nature since I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to these kinds of games. The game does offer a “Simple” mode, but full completion requires taking on the standard, more punishing versions of bosses. Overall, Cuphead is more than just a tough game, it’s a work of art, its blend of retro aesthetics, tight gameplay, and rewarding challenge makes it one of the most memorable indie releases of the last decade.\nA Modern Classic #This is a visually stunning, musically vibrant, and brutally challenging run-and-gun that’s perfect if you enjoy mastering difficult games. I got to admit that I\u0026rsquo;ve never finished the DLC but I highly recommend doing so, there is no excuse, is more content for people who enjoyed it. But it won\u0026rsquo;t win you over, quite the contrary, it is a much more difficult content compared to the base game, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t beat the final boss for example. Another standout is the coop experience, which I could only manage to play the DLC, but not the base game.

I confess that this is the first and only VN that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, this genre never sparkled any interest in me, and I only played this one because of the hype surrounding it, a rare occasion, and I quite enjoyed it though I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself playing any other VN in the future.\nMeta Horror Narrative #The game follows a high school student who joins a literature club at the encouragement of his childhood friend, Sayori. As he interacts with the club members, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika. The player engages in writing poems and building relationships, beneath the surface, however, the game introduces fourth-wall-breaking elements and explores themes of mental health and existential dread, creating a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is eerie. I can safely say that, for the proposal of the story, using the VN format was absolutely the perfect fit for this title, I can even dare to say that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work on any other format.\nGenre-Defining Impact #This game has a bold storytelling and its ability to transform a familiar genre into a medium for psychological horror, in my opinion it rivals titles such as Silent Hill, despite it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;exotic\u0026rdquo; format. Its unexpected twists and meta-narrative have left a lasting impression on the gaming community. For people seeking a unique narrative experience that combines charm with genuine horror, this title offers an unforgettable journey that lingers long after the game ends. I highly recommend this for fans VNs in general, which I doubt they never heard of, but I especially recommend this for people who are not fans of the genre, since it can even make you fall in love with it, or at the very least, experience one of the best and most unique indie titles in gaming history.\n","date":"20 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/doki-doki-literature-club/","section":"Posts","summary":"It starts as a cheerful dating simulator but gradually evolves into a deeply unsettling psychological horror experience.","title":"Doki Doki Literature Club"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 30 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nClassic Dungeon Revival #The first Legend of Grimrock entry is a first-person dungeon crawler that pays homage to classic grid-based RPGs like Dungeon Master.

Its design emphasizes strategic thinking and careful navigation, creating a tense and immersive atmosphere. This was the first game of this genre that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I immediately became a fan. Though I don\u0026rsquo;t consider this something I would use to decide if I would like to play the RPG or not, in my opinion, anybody that likes party RPGs, to any extent, will also enjoy this game.\nClever Sensory Puzzles #The puzzles are clever and varied, requiring observation, logic, and experimentation, especially because they use your senses a lot, things like visual details on walls (similar to Doom secrets) and audio queues, will definitely make a difference, so I recommend trying to enhance the immersion using headphones. You must manage their party’s resources carefully while solving environmental challenges, which adds depth to the gameplay. Especially because you can easily soft-lock yourself if you don\u0026rsquo;t level up your party properly, or use a party combination with zero synergy, for example.\nAtmosphere and Challenge #The dungeon’s atmospheric design, with detailed visuals and moody lighting, enhances the sense of immersion and danger. While the combat is functional, it can feel repetitive at times, and enemy AI is relatively simple, making some encounters predictable, though this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they are not challenging, quite the opposite, form start to finish you can easily face a game over screen, especially at the very beginning, or at the very end of the game, which it escalates a lot, forcing you to use your party to the max.

This gave the game a distinct identity at a time when most studios were moving fully into 3D platformers. It was one of the few titles of this sub-genre that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever played, and I can totally see myself bring blown away by this if I played it back in the day, so I genuinely recognize it\u0026rsquo;s impact in the industry.\nClever Core Mechanics #Gameplay centers around Klonoa’s Wind Ring, which lets him grab enemies and either throw them forward as projectiles or use them as a boost to reach higher ground. This simple mechanic fuels surprisingly clever puzzles and keeps the action engaging throughout. The controls are tight, and the level design steadily layers new challenges without ever overwhelming the player, platforming feels satisfying enough even withouth being the main focus. I\u0026rsquo;ve also played the GBA Klonoa, but this one feels much nicer in my opinion, it has a more balanced approach to puzzle and platforming, instead of being totally focused in the puzzle side.\nWhimsical Yet Melancholic #The game’s presentation is one of its strongest points. Its worlds are colorful and whimsical, paired with a bright, catchy soundtrack that perfectly captures the dreamlike setting, although it is not the best OST of this genre, it is still very high quality and memorable. But underneath the cheerful surface lies an emotional, even melancholic story that takes players by surprise. Which I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single reason of it being this way other than it being released on a not very mature gaming industry period of time, since this game was meant to be for children as it\u0026rsquo;s target audience.\nBittersweet Cult Classic #By the end, Door to Phantomile delivers a bittersweet narrative that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It’s not a very long or difficult game, but its charm, inventiveness, and emotional weight have earned it a cult classic status, I consider it an underrated gem which should have way more titles released already.

While some players may miss the more open-ended exploration of earlier titles, the streamlined design keeps the experience engaging and well-paced. While it feels like a Tomb Raider title, it does not have the same level of depth of the PlayStation 1 title, it really feels much more linear and action-focused.\nPolished Combat Presentation #Combat is accessible and fast-paced, featuring improved controls and animations. Some vehicle sections, however, were criticized for awkward handling, which slightly disrupts the otherwise smooth gameplay. Visually, the game impressed for its time, with detailed environments, realistic character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance immersion.\nEnjoyable Yet Skippable #A lot of people generally praised Legend for revitalizing the franchise. It earned positive reviews for returning to the series’ adventurous roots, balancing platforming, puzzles, and combat effectively.

Boss battles often involve quick-time events, which add cinematic flair but can become overwhelming.\nDerivative Yet Accessible #This one really feels like a 360-era Ninja Gaiden rip-off, not very unique but it at least made it possible to have a similar experience on PC at the time, since Ninja Gaiden was a 360 exclusive back in the day. The PC version of Ninja Blade was criticized for technical issues, including glitches, crashes, and performance problems. The port lacked official updates or mod support, which left many of these problems unresolved and diminished the overall experience.\nMixed Reception Legacy #Some praised its over-the-top style and cinematic moments, describing it as silly but fun, while others found it lackluster, comparing it unfavorably to Ninja Gaiden and God of War. Overall, it received mixed reviews and holds a \u0026ldquo;Mixed or Average\u0026rdquo; score on Metacritic, a game that had great potential but lacked courage to become much more unique compared to a lot of other similar games at the time.\nSkippable Cinematic Action #My biggest issue with this game are the bossfights, they are it\u0026rsquo;s weakest point, lasting too long and not having any interesting enough mechanic, not to mention it has a very high amount of them. It offers a visually striking and action-packed experience, best suited for players looking for a straightforward, cinematic game, but I really consider this a very skippable game, there are many other similar title with higher quality.\n","date":"19 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/ninja-blade/","section":"Posts","summary":"This game is an action game developed by FromSoftware, set in a near-future Tokyo.","title":"Ninja Blade"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Survival Reboot #This entry rebooted the classic survival horror franchise with a darker, more cinematic tone inspired by Resident Evil.

The game features fixed camera angles, tank controls, and puzzle-solving mixed with combat against shadowy creatures. Its lighting system was a standout for the time, flashlights dynamically illuminated environments, creating a tense atmosphere.\nAtmosphere Over Limitations #This was especially awesome at the time simply because there was no other game trying to use any lightning mechanics because of the technical limitations of the PlayStation platform. While the atmosphere and graphics were praised, it didn’t quite reach the polish or tension of its genre rivals. Some people criticized it for being more limited compared to other similar games at the time, though in my opinion the limitations makes this unique, not every game should be judged by the same rules since they don\u0026rsquo;t intend to deliver the same experience.\nEssential Horror Classic #There are plenty of contents o this one since you can play using two MCs, different stories and gameplay, and back in the PlayStation 1 era you had two CDs for this, so there are plenty of a good time to be had here.

The MC is called Senua, a Pict warrior on a harrowing journey into Helheim to save the soul of her lover, all while battling psychosis. The game uses haunting visuals, atmospheric design, and an outstanding binaural audio system to immerse players in her fractured mind, making the experience both unsettling and unforgettable.\nCinematic Sensory Immersion #Visually, the game impresses with its cinematic presentation, detailed environments, and motion-captured performance, whose portrayal of Senua earned widespread praise, very impressive even for standards at the time since this was not an uncommon practice. The sound design is especially impactful, with voices constantly whispering, taunting, and guiding the player, simulating the struggle of living with inner turmoil. This combination of art direction and performance elevates the narrative far beyond traditional video game storytelling.\nSimple Yet Thematic Gameplay #However, the gameplay itself is more straightforward. Combat consists of light and heavy attacks, dodging, and parrying, and while functional, it lacks depth and can become repetitive, though this is really not the main focus of the game. The puzzles, which often involve matching shapes and runes in the environment, fit thematically but risk feeling redundant over time, so puzzles are definitely a standout on this one. Despite this, the simplicity allows the focus to remain on atmosphere and story rather than mechanics.\nAn Unforgettable Experience #This game succeeds not as a traditional action game, but as an emotionally charged experience that blends myth, psychology, and tragedy. Its bravery in addressing mental health, paired with exceptional production values, makes it one of the most unique and memorable indie titles of its time. This is truly one of the most unique games the industry has provided, and a must-play for everybody.

The gameplay is its strongest element, with fluid combat that mixes quick dashes, melee strikes, and a variety of powerful weapons. Encounters are challenging, rewarding quick reflexes and smart use of the environment. Combined with responsive controls and a high skill ceiling, the action feels both brutal and exhilarating.\nNeon Atmosphere and Sound #Visually, Ruiner is striking, its bold red-and-black color palette, heavy use of neon lights, and stylish character designs create an oppressive yet captivating atmosphere. The soundtrack, filled with pulsating electronic and industrial beats, perfectly complements the violent, chaotic gameplay, making every fight feel intense. Especially in the atmosphere and OST department, this game is heavily inspired by what Hotline Miami was trying to do, from the gameplay perspective, so if you like that kind of game I would heavily recommend this one.\nStyle Over Story #Where Ruiner falters is in its story though, the narrative is minimal and often cliché, with underdeveloped characters and little emotional weight. Dialogue is sparse and the plot feels more like a backdrop for the action than a driving force. The game is short but tightly paced, while some may find it lacking in replay value, others will appreciate its focused, adrenaline-fueled experience.

Set in the northern province of Tamriel, the MC is called Dragonborn, a prophesied hero capable of harnessing the power of dragons. While the main story follows a battle against the return of these ancient creatures, much of the game’s appeal lies in the countless side quests, guild storylines, and emergent events that let players shape their own path.\nMemorable Main Quest #While I highly encourage everybody to play this game as much as possible, trying to experience the side-quests on your own pace, I can safely say that if you only want to experience the main quest then you\u0026rsquo;ll still have an amazing experience. It is truly one of the most unique main stories compared to any and all videogames at the time, and in the gaming history in general. Though it sometimes lacks good characters to carry them, at least in my opinion, despite having a lot of different factions and stories behind them.\nA Vast Living World #The world of Skyrim is vast and diverse, filled with snowy peaks, dense forests, ancient ruins, and bustling cities, each brimming with lore and secrets to discover. Its flexible gameplay allows players to approach challenges as a warrior, mage, thief, or a blend of all three, making every playthrough feel different. Though you are not limited to traditional classes, or even races, you can use the unfun and boring regular human, or something like a Khajit, which is a cat-like race that helps with stealth-focused playstyles. Combat can sometimes feel unrefined, but the variety of spells, weapons, and stealth mechanics helps maintain engagement.\nEnduring Modding Legacy #Despite technical issues and occasional bugs, Skyrim’s atmosphere, modding community, and sheer depth of exploration have kept it alive well beyond its release. I highly encourage the exploration of the modding community, which is still strong even for today\u0026rsquo;s standards, creating whole games out of them, or whole different ways of playing it, so much that makes it feel like a completely different game. This is similar to something like the Fallout series modding scene, or even the STALKER one.

Each baby gives Yoshi unique abilities, which adds variety to the puzzles and level design. This is it\u0026rsquo;s biggest standout compared to the previous title, making the gameplay and levels much more unique in comparison, so if you enjoyed the first one there are no excuses not to play this one too.\nFaithful Yet Flawed #The game plays very similarly to the original, but the dual-screen setup sometimes makes it hard to see hazards above or below, leading to cheap hits. While it doesn’t innovate much beyond the multiple babies mechanic, it’s still a solid and charming platformer with great music and plenty of challenge for completionists.

Boss battles are creative and intense, and the gothic castle environments show impressive detail.\nUneven Design Choices #Unfortunately, the game struggles with pacing and structure. The modern-day city environments are visually bland compared to the atmospheric castle, and forced stealth sections often feel awkward and unnecessary. The story is unfocused and sometimes incoherent, despite the previous title having a very simplistic tale in comparison, they decided to create a more complex one this time. Exploration feels limited, and repetitive encounters dilute the impact of the otherwise enjoyable combat.\nFlawed but Enjoyable #The result is a game with strong technical execution and some genuinely thrilling moments, but one that is weighed down by uneven design choices and a lack of narrative clarity. Fans of the first Lords of Shadow may find moments to enjoy here, but many will see it as a step down from its predecessor, though I still enjoyed this one greatly.

The narrative is dark and mythic, filled with twists and an overarching sense of epic scale, giving the player a strong sense of purpose as they traverse a post-apocalyptic Earth. Combat is one of the game’s strongest points, offering satisfying melee combos, ranged attacks, and supernatural powers that feel weighty and impactful.\nAction Meets Exploration #It keeps itself close to the level of quality and complexity of games such as Devil May Cry. The game also features platforming elements and environmental puzzles reminiscent of classic adventure games, adding variety to the core combat loops. Some say it even reaches the same levels of quality of games such as The Legend of Zelda when it comes to the puzzles, exploration and dungeons. Exploration is rewarding, with hidden upgrades, collectibles, and lore scattered throughout the world, encouraging you to fully engage with its environments.\nStylish, Lasting Impact #While some textures, animations, and camera angles show their age, Darksiders’ distinctive comic-inspired art style remains striking and gives the game a unique visual identity.

The game’s world is a decaying, interconnected labyrinth of gothic spires, crumbling castles, and eerie swamps, each area brimming with secrets, shortcuts, and deadly foes. Every encounter demands focus, whether it’s a lone hollow knight or a towering boss with multiple, unpredictable phases, rewarding patience, precise timing, and adaptability.\nRefined Combat Mastery #It really feels like they learned a lot when it comes to the pacing and mechanics from the Bloodborne title, and decided to gracefully translate it into a Dark Souls title, and it was done masterfully. This one has the best level design in my opinion, really makes you want to replay it a couple of times just for testing out new builds, since they introduced weapon arts and much much more spells for you to play around. Not to mention the large amount of bosses and unique weapons you can obtain from them, this is truly the best last Dark Souls title we could ever get. I played and replayed this one quite a bit, but I admit that I was never able to beat Midir haha.\nFire Fades Beautifully #The narrative remains deliberately cryptic, told through fragmented dialogue, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling, inviting you to piece together its somber tale of fading fire and cyclical despair.

Its dark, steampunk-inspired visuals and haunting soundtrack create a strong sense of dread and decay, which is one of its standout qualities. What made me interested in this game was the artstyle, I love pixel art and horror, so this is the perfect combination for me, and if you want to play this game solely because of this then I encourage you doing so.\nFlexible Yet Unbalanced Combat #Combat in Morbid offers a mix of melee and ranged attacks, giving players strategic flexibility. However, some mechanics, such as charge attacks and rolling, can feel overpowered, while parrying may come across as inconsistent. I recommend not trying too hard to optimize any kind of playstyle since this game won\u0026rsquo;t leave much room for you to do this. You can upgrade your weapons using status effects gems, but there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any clear way of finding the enemies weakness in order to make this more effective.\nExploration Without Guidance #The interconnected world encourages exploration, but navigation can be tricky due to the lack of a detailed map and occasionally unclear progression paths. You can access the map in the bonfire-like statues, which are your checkpoints, but they are very simplistic, this lack of detail may seem daunting if you haven\u0026rsquo;t explored the map before finding it. The game presents a challenging experience, though it is more accessible than many other Soulslike titles, making it approachable for newcomers to the genre.\nAtmospheric but Niche #It lacks a comprehensive New Game+ mode or multiple endings, which could have added replay value.

The hand-drawn art style and moody, grim atmosphere give the game a distinct personality, while the Sanctuary system provides safe havens and upgrade points that mirror the bonfire concept from Soulslike titles.\nMethodical Combat Exploration #The combat is precise and weighty, requiring players to manage stamina, dodge effectively, and learn enemy attack patterns, making mistakes costly but fair. Exploration is rewarding, with hidden areas, shortcuts, and platforming sections that encourage revisiting older zones once new abilities are unlocked. However, the lack of an in-game map can make navigation difficult, and some later bosses feel easier once strong gear is obtained. Particularly I played using a DEX build with the focus in Katanas, DPS and such, so nothing new to me since I play all Soulslike titles this way and this one was a very good one when it comes to this playstyle.\nA Genre-Defining Indie #Overall, Salt and Sanctuary succeeds in translating the essence of a 3D Soulslike into a tight, atmospheric 2D experience.

Its vibrant, cartoon-like graphics and catchy soundtrack capture the whimsical spirit of the series perfectly. Being surprisingly developed by Capcom, and not Nintendo, it stills feels as part of the mainline series, especially when it comes to the more cartoonish-looking Link timeline.

The game introduces a unique “persona system,” letting Aveline disguise herself as an Assassin, a Lady, or a Slave, each with distinct abilities and limitations. This mechanic, along with the vibrant historical setting, gives Liberation a unique flavor compared to the mainline Assassin’s Creed entries.\nShort, Uneven Campaign #The campaign is notably shorter, clocking in at around 8~10 hours, and the narrative, while intriguing, can feel rushed and occasionally confusing due to abrupt transitions and limited exposition. Mission variety is limited, with several repetitive tailing or eavesdropping tasks, and the AI often behaves inconsistently, swinging between overly alert and strangely oblivious. Though this is expected since this was originally released for a handheld, which has simpler and shorter titles compared to regular consoles.\nFor Hardcore Fans #Combat is serviceable but basic, relying heavily on counter-kill mechanics familiar from earlier games, so no news on this regard, it is the good old AC classic combat. While the visuals are sharper than the Vita version, they don’t match the scale or polish of other Assassin’s Creed titles from the same era. Despite these flaws, many fans appreciate Liberation HD for its fresh perspective, focused scope, and Aveline’s engaging character, I would only recommend this one for hardcore AC fans, otherwise, it is a skippable title.\n","date":"13 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/","section":"Posts","summary":"An enhanced port of the original PS Vita title, where you play as Aveline de Grandpré, a rare female lead in the series.","title":"Assassin's Creed Liberation HD"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 8 hours ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nDidn’t Quite Click #I gave Borderlands 2 a couple of hours, hoping to get hooked, but it just didn’t click with me, I don\u0026rsquo;t even know why I gave this one a chance if I didn\u0026rsquo;t really liked the first title.

A lot of fans are not very fond to the Lords of Shadows franchise, not me though, I love it and it is the only game I\u0026rsquo;ve 100% back in PlayStation 3 era.\nWhip-Based Combat Focus #The gameplay focuses on a mix of whip-based combat, platforming, and light exploration, so the classic whip is back in place of the more RPG weapon varieties. You take control of multiple protagonists across different time periods, each with their own abilities, offering variety but sometimes breaking the pacing. Combat is satisfying and weighty, with combos, magic, and sub-weapons adding depth, though the frequent use of quick-time events can feel intrusive.\nLinear Design Limitations #While it borrows structural cues from Metroidvania design, exploration is relatively linear and often lacks meaningful rewards, making backtracking feel less engaging, and it is understandable since this game was originally released for a handheld. The narrative, while steeped in Belmont family drama, can be predictable and is occasionally interrupted by character switches that disrupt momentum, this may hurts pacing a bit.

Each player selects a unique hero with distinct abilities and roles, creating endless strategic possibilities and team compositions.\nMod That Changed Gaming #This is one of the examples that a mod can become, not just a game, but it can shift the entire gaming industry and community, similar to what happened to other titles such as League of Legends and Team Fortress, which share a lot of similarities to DOTA and DOTA2. I admit that I was late to the party for these titles, I had home internet very late compared to most people so I never got into competitive online gaming as much as wanted to, so it was very hard for me to become a good enough player in those games.\nDeep Mechanics Mastery #The game is renowned for its deep mechanics, requiring not only individual skill and quick reflexes but also strong teamwork, map awareness, and tactical planning. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the rewarding sense of progression and mastery keeps players hooked. Regular updates and a vibrant community continually refresh the game’s meta, making every match feel dynamic and engaging.\nDemanding Esports Giant #This game changes so much to the point that you really need to dedicate yourself almost solely to playing this title, and no other, in order to keep up with it\u0026rsquo;s changes, similar to other MOBAs such as League of Legends. DOTA 2’s influence extends beyond casual play, boasting one of the largest and most passionate esports communities worldwide, with tournaments offering massive prize pools.

Created almost entirely by Toby Fox, it draws inspiration from classic titles like EarthBound (fun-fact: the song \u0026ldquo;Megalomania\u0026rdquo; comes from this game, it was not originally composed by Fox), yet quickly establishes its own distinct personality. The pixel art style and catchy chiptune soundtrack may appear simple at first glance, but both are meticulously crafted to match the game’s shifting tone, the OST is by far one of the best aspects in my opinion, it is one of the best soundtracks in gaming history.\nMorality Through Choice #What sets Undertale apart is its unconventional approach to combat and morality. Instead of the usual “fight or run” dynamic, you can choose to resolve encounters peacefully, talking and negotiating with enemies until they no longer wish to fight. This choice between mercy and violence isn’t just a gimmick, it fundamentally changes the story, the characters’ reactions, and even the tone of the entire game. Every decision feels personal and consequential, making multiple playthroughs not only worthwhile, but essential to truly grasp the game’s depth. I highly encourage this game is played at least twice, so it is possible to experience both the pacifist and the genocide routes.\nUnforgettable Character Cast #The cast is full of memorable personalities, from the goofy skeleton brothers Sans and Papyrus to the awkward yet endearing scientist Alphys, each brought to life through sharp writing and expressive spritework. The characters alone can easily carry this game, not to mention it\u0026rsquo;s fanbase which is still dedicated yet to this day, part of this has to do with the amazing cast. The humor is sharp and self-aware, but it’s balanced by moments of genuine emotion that can be unexpectedly moving.\nExpectation-Breaking Design #The game constantly subverts expectations, whether by poking fun at RPG tropes or breaking the fourth wall in ways that make you feel like the game itself is aware of you. At the time, this was a very unique trait since very few games did this, though nowadays it has become more common since this title had, and still has, a big influence in the gaming industry. I\u0026rsquo;ll never forget how I was blown away by the first time I played this title, it is one of those games that you wish you could have your memory erased so that you could play it for the first time again.\nShort Yet Timeless #At around 6~8 hours for a first run, it is relatively short, but it leaves a lasting impression that far outlives its playtime. It’s a rare example of a game that’s as playful as it is profound, capable of making you laugh, think, and even question your own choices. Whether you take the pacifist route, embrace chaos, or walk a morally gray path, Undertale ensures that your story, and the feelings it inspires, will be uniquely your own. I consider this one of the best games in history, alongside something like Final Fantasy VI, VII and others, don\u0026rsquo;t skip this, and also, don\u0026rsquo;t skip the other Toby Fox games, Deltarune is basically part of Undertale and a must play for the fans.\n","date":"11 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/undertale/","section":"Posts","summary":"A one-of-a-kind indie RPG that blends retro aesthetics with modern storytelling in a way few games have matched.","title":"Undertale"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 10 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nPunishing Retro Challenge #This is a brutally challenging retro-style platformer inspired by arcade classics like Ghosts ’n Goblins and Rastan.

This system encourages experimentation and can lead to hilarious mishaps, especially in the heat of co-op battles. The tone is lighthearted and filled with quirky humor, leaning heavily on parody and pop culture references, and I genuinely found myself laughing out loud and very often, it is not cheap unfunny humor.\nCo-op Driven Mayhem #The campaign is relatively short and straightforward, serving more as a playground for magical mayhem than a deep narrative journey. While the single-player mode is serviceable, the game truly shines in cooperative play, where teamwork and accidental sabotage often go hand-in-hand. And although I never played this game in co-op, I highly advise doing so, it\u0026rsquo;ll be way more fun than playing alone, at the same time, in my opinion, the main campaign is good enough to face it as a single-player title, similar to the first entry.\nFamiliar Yet Amusing #However, Magicka 2 has its flaws, some players found balance issues, occasional bugs, and a lack of substantial new content compared to the first game. Despite this, it remains a fun, chaotic, and uniquely silly experience for those looking to enjoy magic-slinging madness with friends, you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with this one if you enjoyed the first game, and if not, than don\u0026rsquo;t even try because this one won\u0026rsquo;t win you over anytime soon.\n","date":"8 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/magicka-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"The 2nd Magicka entry is a top-down action-adventure game that builds on the chaotic charm of its predecessor.","title":"Magicka 2"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 16 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nHigh-Speed Blade Combat #This game trades Metal Gear’s traditional stealth gameplay for high-speed, over-the-top action.

And while we had seen this character in the mainline series before, you could never play as him, so this was a very different and unique approach, and even though it divided fans at the time, I enjoyed this one a lot even though I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the MGS franchise.\nOver-the-Top Spectacle #The combat is flashy, responsive, and bolstered by a bombastic soundtrack and some of the most memorable boss fights in the action genre, even though this is the first time this franchise had an entry like this. The story is deliberately over-the-top, leaning heavily into camp and political satire, but it lacks the depth and complexity of the mainline Metal Gear series. The campaign is short, often taking less than eight hours to complete, though its pacing is tight and the boss encounters make up for the brevity. Replay value comes mainly from higher difficulty modes and the satisfaction of mastering the parry system.\nStylish Yet Flawed Port #On PC, the game suffers from some technical shortcomings. The camera can be frustrating, the controls feel clunky without a controller, and the port has resolution and frame-rate quirks. Despite these flaws, the core gameplay remains exciting, and with a gamepad, it offers a thrilling, stylish action experience. For those who value spectacle and fast-paced combat over stealth and deep storytelling, it’s a sharp and satisfying ride, I\u0026rsquo;d say this is a must for fans of Hack\u0026rsquo;N Slash titles such as Devil May Cry.

It’s best suited for players in the mood for an accessible, nostalgia-driven journey, but those looking for deeper gameplay or a fresh twist on the formula may find it a bit lightweight.\n","date":"8 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/","section":"Posts","summary":"A colorful game clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda, particularly Wind Waker and A Link to the Past.","title":"Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 3 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nGroundbreaking Puzzle Concept #The first Portal is a short yet groundbreaking first-person puzzle game from Valve, originally released as part of The Orange Box, which was a bundle of Valve titles put together. The MC is called Chell, a silent test subject armed with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, capable of creating two linked portals on certain surfaces. This simple mechanic fuels an incredibly clever series of physics-based puzzles, gradually escalating in complexity and creativity without ever overwhelming you.\nIconic Villain Narrative #The game’s pacing is razor-sharp, each chamber teaches you something new, and just when you think you’ve mastered it, the rules are twisted in unexpected ways so it never gets stale. Beneath its sterile test-chamber setting lies a darkly comedic narrative, delivered through the sarcastic, passive-aggressive voice of GLaDOS, an AI whose cheerful malice turns the sterile environment into a deeply unsettling backdrop.This character alone carries the whole plot of the game, she is praised as one of the best villains of all time in gaming history.\nShort Yet Timeless #At only 3~4 hours long, this game wastes no time, delivering a concentrated shot of innovative gameplay, memorable writing, and a now-iconic ending. It’s a perfect example of “less is more,” and even after all these years, it remains one of the most original puzzle experiences ever made.

So no big news on this regard, the core mechanic is exactly the same as the first one, just expanding upon the levels of complexity when it comes to the puzzles, and also a totally different story and villain (no spoilers). It delivers a longer, more varied campaign with inventive puzzle design, new mechanics like gels and excursion funnels, and a sharp, witty narrative.\nBigger, Better Sequel #The humor is dark and clever, and the pacing balances brain-teasing puzzles with engaging story beats. On PC, the controls feel precise, and the Source Engine’s visual style, while not cutting-edge today, still holds up due to clean art direction. As much as I don\u0026rsquo;t like to repeat myself, these is not much new to talk about this one when comparing to the first entry.

Rather than a simple port, the game received visual enhancements, smoother controls, and QOL improvements like widescreen support and quick saving. It retains the gritty, hellish atmosphere that set it apart from other classic Doom entries, with a darker, more oppressive tone reinforced by moody lighting and eerie sound design. Particularly this is one of my favorite Doom entries simply because of it\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere alone, very different from it\u0026rsquo;s predecessors, this is also the reason why I like the hated Doom 3, I feel both of them have the very same proposal when it comes to the feeling it tries to provoke from the player.\nMaze-Focused Combat #The gameplay remains tight and responsive, preserving the series\u0026rsquo; hallmark fast-paced combat and maze-like level design. And even though the previous entries also had similar formulas, the level of \u0026ldquo;maze-like\u0026rdquo; is very high on this this one, starting from the first few levels, and never changing until the last level, which can be a bummer for some. The levels are more puzzle-oriented than in Doom or Doom II, which gives the game a slower, more methodical feel, which not everybody is a fan of, so I would only play this one if you can enjoy both approaches. Weapon feedback is satisfying, and combat retains its classic rhythm without feeling outdated.\nExpanded Epilogue Content #A notable addition is the new “Lost Levels” campaign, which acts as an epilogue and ties into the lore of Doom Eternal, making this version more than just a nostalgia trip. Critics and fans alike praised the remaster for its atmosphere, improved visuals, and the care put into updating it for PC. Particularly I was not interested in playing this part of the content, but I advise fans don\u0026rsquo;t skip this section. However, some noted that the game can be excessively dark by default, requiring manual brightness adjustments, which was also a thing in the original game, but more easily fixed on this remaster. A few quirks from the original remain, but they don’t detract significantly from the experience.\nChallenging Yet Essential #I would also advise trying to play the secret levels, in order to make the final one way easier, this way to unlock some secrets that makes the final boss less challenging, and it can be very challenging, unfortunately for me I didn\u0026rsquo;t followed my own advise. Another standout for me is that this one feels harder than other Doom titles, at least for me, even while not playing at the highest difficulty level, you can easily die at least once on every single level. Overall, Doom 64’s 2020 release is a strong, atmospheric shooter that respects its roots while feeling polished on modern hardware, it is a must play for fans of FPS titles in general, even more so now that it is more easily playable on modern platforms, no excuse to skip this one.\n","date":"7 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/doom-64/","section":"Posts","summary":"A faithful remaster of the 1997 Nintendo 64 classic, brought to modern systems by Nightdive Studios.","title":"Doom 64"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 70 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nGenre-Defining JRPG #The 2012 PC release of Final Fantasy VII is a straightforward port of the legendary 1997 PlayStation title, it retains the original game\u0026rsquo;s powerful storytelling, iconic characters, and strategic turn-based combat, which helped define the golden era of JRPGs. A lot of ideas used on this title, on literally every single element of it\u0026rsquo;s mechanics, are still used to this day, especially when it comes to the narrative and story-telling. Never before we had seen things like flashbacks and deep backstories for important characters, they pretty much simply existed, and you had a paragraph worth of information about them, mostly mechanical ones, they never felt like real people that could actually exist, and you could relate to.\nFaithful Yet Dated Port #This version is essentially a cleaned-up reissue of the earlier 1998 PC port, with a few minor updates to make it run on modern systems. It includes support for cloud saves, achievements, and a slightly improved MIDI soundtrack, though it still lacks the polish of a full remaster, so only play this if you can tolerate decades old graphics. The character models are blocky, the pre-rendered backgrounds are low-resolution, and there\u0026rsquo;s no native widescreen support, similar to the original title. QOL improvements are minimal, despite these shortcomings, the game remains fully playable and faithful to the original experience, so if you never had the chance to play the original, this is your best bet on modern systems.\nMods Enhance Experience #For players new to the series or long-time fans revisiting Midgar, this version offers a nostalgic trip, but it feels dated without the help of mods. Particularly speaking I never used any mods, though I did some research and there is an amazing modding community behind this title, especially when it comes to Steam. So I highly recommend exploring the Steam community, you\u0026rsquo;ll certainly find something to enhance the experience, a good one would be to improve the 3D model details. Ultimately, it’s a solid way to experience a classic, but not the definitive version by today’s standards. I consider this one of my childhood\u0026rsquo;s best experiences playing videogames, I\u0026rsquo;ll never forget the first time I saw it and was absolutely blown away by it\u0026rsquo;s graphics.\nTimeless Narrative Legacy #I remember it vividly, it was in the second disc section where you board into a moving train, in order to try to stop it, lots of fighting and a timer to see if you can make it before it crashes into a small town that exists in the train tracks. For a lot of people this was their first cinematic gaming experience, it was for me, and an unforgettable one that deserves all the respect of the entire gaming industry, for following a lot of it\u0026rsquo;s formulas, even up to this day. It is definitely a must for FF and JRPG fans, don\u0026rsquo;t skip it, absolutely one of the best games of all time, with one of the best stories and characters the gaming industry could provide. I also highly recommend to 100% this title, it has some amazing optional content, such as hidden characters, bosses, dungeons and unique items.\n","date":"7 August 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/final-fantasy-vii/","section":"Posts","summary":"The 2012 PC release is a simple port of the 1997 classic, preserving its iconic story, characters, and turn-based combat.","title":"Final Fantasy VII"},{"content":" 🎮 Steam ⏳ 12 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nZombie Survival Crafting #The first How to Survive title is a top-down, action-survival game set on a zombie-infested tropical archipelago.

The core gameplay revolves around scavenging for food, water, and materials to survive, while fighting off increasingly aggressive undead enemies. The game stands out for its humorous tone, especially through the “Kovac’s Rules” survival guides narrated by an eccentric masked character, which inject a quirky charm into the otherwise grim setting.\nMemorable Humorous Guide #And trust me when I say this, this character carries the whole game, from start to finish, it is indeed the big standout, you\u0026rsquo;ll have it\u0026rsquo;s quotes and voice into your memory for a very long time after playing this.

Combat is responsive and satisfying, particularly when using crafted weapons like explosive arrows or homemade chainsaws.\nFun Yet Repetitive #Local and online co-op modes also enhance the experience by turning the survival challenge into a fun, shared adventure, though one I could not experience myself, unfortunately. However, the game suffers from repetitive environments and quests, with a lot of backtracking that can make the gameplay feel tedious over time.

The confined corridors, limited resources, and puzzle-solving elements evoke a sense of tension that fans of classic Resident Evil will find familiar, which at the time was a standout since the RE community didn\u0026rsquo;t really liked how more action-oriented the series was becoming.\nBalanced Action Horror #The PC version benefits from upgraded visuals, including higher-resolution textures and more detailed environments compared to its handheld origins. And this is the first and only version of this game that I played, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any nostalgia for it, even though, I consider this one of the best RE experiences since it strikes an almost perfect balance of action and horror. While the story is somewhat pulpy and over-the-top, a trait of this franchise to be honest, it is presented in an episodic format that helps maintain pacing and suspense, similar to something like Alan Wake, though without all the visual appeal of mimicking a real TV series.\nReplayable Combat Modes #Combat is a blend of strategic aiming and straightforward shooting mechanics, with some segments leaning more heavily into action. The mechanics of this game are very familiar for those who played RE4 in the PlayStation 2, it really feels like Capcom reused a lot of things of that title, such as animations and game assets, which is not a bummer in my opinion since I loved it. The inclusion of Raid Mode adds a layer of replayability, allowing you to tackle combat-focused challenges with a variety of characters and weapons.

Its branching level paths offer multiple routes and endings, greatly increasing its replay value. Ground and tank-based missions add variety, while boss fights are consistently creative and satisfying, there is even an underwater level in which you pilot a submarine.\nChallenging Branching Paths #I played all the 15 available levels and got the secret ending, by going the \u0026ldquo;hard route\u0026rdquo;, which is the one at the left corner, and it indeed is way harder than the regular one.

The Frostbite 3 engine powers impressive visuals and dynamic elements like collapsing skyscrapers and flooding streets. Expanding upon the most praised mechanic of the same engine, with even more impressive elements that could be destroyed, such as entire buildings.\nMultiplayer Over Campaign #While the single-player campaign is forgettable and riddled with clichés, the real strength lies in its 64-player multiplayer, featuring diverse maps, vehicles, and tactical depth, this time, focusing more on infantry combat than vehicle warfare. Though since the servers were very flexible, you could always find games focused on one or the other, but the general common feeling is that the map design had infantry in mind, or even aerial and aquatic vehicle combat, compared to Battlefield 3 which focused more on ground warfare.\nRough Launch, Redeemed #At launch, the game was plagued with bugs and stability issues, but post-release patches and community support significantly improved performance and gameplay over time. And unfortunately this title also uses a browser-based lobby, so no in-game way to search for matches, servers and etc, which is a big downside in my opinion since the website\u0026rsquo;s UX/UI was terrible.

Set in a decaying, overgrown New York City encased in a giant dome, the game combines high-tech sci-fi elements with lush natural environments, creating a striking and immersive world. So, similarly to Crysis 2. this one also heavily focuses on urban settings, compared to the first entry to the series, though this time, with a nice mix between jungle/forest and urban environments, which fits perfectly with the game story and narrative at the time.\nNanosuit Combat Freedom #The MC this time is Prophet, a longtime character of the series, a soldier equipped with a powerful nanosuit that lets you switch between stealth, speed, armor, and enhanced strength on the fly. So no big news on how the suit works on this one. This flexibility allows you to approach combat however they like, whether through silent takedowns or explosive firefights, and this was a trend back in the day, every shooter had both ways of playing, giving you a more flexible combat in the end. Though this quickly started to get repetitive since all shooters tarted copying this trait, trying to call this feature \u0026ldquo;freedom on how you approach combat\u0026rdquo;, while in reality, all you really need to decide is between stealth or non-stealth combat, so not as complex as something like immersive sims in any way.\nShort but Spectacular #The campaign is relatively short, lasting around six to seven hours, but it\u0026rsquo;s packed with intense moments and cinematic flair. The signature Predator Bow adds a fresh and satisfying layer to stealth gameplay, and this was definitely this game\u0026rsquo;s biggest standout, this thing is very fun to use. While the story tries to wrap up the trilogy\u0026rsquo;s complex plot, it can be hard to follow if you\u0026rsquo;re not already invested in the series\u0026rsquo; lore.

It throws you into a procedurally generated tower filled with enemies, traps, and bosses, demanding quick reflexes and constant forward momentum. Visually, the game is stunning, embracing a synthwave aesthetic with glowing pixel art and explosive effects that channel the energy of classic arcade games blended with a dystopian future vibe. And I\u0026rsquo;m immensely biased when I say I absolutely loved everything when it comes to the soundtrack since I\u0026rsquo;m a die-hard synthwave fan, it is one of those games that you end up saving it\u0026rsquo;s OST to your regularly listened songs.\nFast Builds, Favorite Character #Gameplay focuses on tight, high-speed combat, you can choose from a handful of characters with different traits and weapons, and collect upgrades during their run that can enhance abilities, weapons, or introduce tradeoffs like time penalties or curses. The starting character is the one I liked the least, but the one I played the most since the one you unlock while playing with it is my favorite one, which is an enhanced version of the same character, I believe it is the first version the developers intended to go for it.\nVisual Overload Issues #The action is fluid but can become overwhelming at times due to the sheer amount of visual effects on screen, which sometimes makes it difficult to track your character or incoming damage. It is especially bad if you turn the effects to the max, so I highly recommend turn most effects off if you want to improve your performance in the runs. It is not as bad in the first area, but as soon as more enemies start spawning it becomes simply impossible to keep track of what is happening.\nFun But Repetitive #While the core gameplay loop is satisfying and the controls are responsive, the game does suffer from limited content. Enemy variety, boss types, and room layouts can start to feel repetitive after a few hours, which affects long-term replayability, still, it excels as a short-session, high-intensity roguelike experience. I think this is the main reason why it isn\u0026rsquo;t more popular, not to mention this makes the game shorter since you get used to it way more quickly than other similar titles such as Wizard of Legend for example.\nStylish Coop Roguelike #And while I played this game completely solo, I highly recommend trying to find a friend to enjoy the local coop, and I intend to add this one to the roaster of coop games that I play on occasion with my friends. In summary, Black Future \u0026lsquo;88 delivers a stylish and adrenaline-fueled experience that’s perfect for fans of fast, unforgiving action.

I consider this game the best PlayStation 2 title, and one of the best games of all time, out of all the MGS titles, this was the one I replayed the most, is not just about the story but also about how fun it is compared to the other ones. The PlayStation 2 is also the only platform in which more than one MGS title was released, up until this point the team decided to wait for new technological advancements happened before introducing a new title, in order to use their creativity to the fullest to bring new and unique mechanics to the table.\nInnovative Design Mastery #This happened since the very fist MGS title, and this is no different, you need to press harder on the triggers of the controller in order to actually fire the weapon, not to mention the unique boss mechanics which, depending on your actions, could lead to completely different boss fights, or even routes for the main plot development, though never changing the main story, at least. This is one of the best games of all time and I recommend everybody to play this any way possible, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter the platform, this will for sure be forever one of the best games of all time.\n","date":"4 July 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/","section":"Posts","summary":"A stealth-action that blends espionage, survival, and emotional storytelling into one of the most iconic entries in the series.","title":"Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater"},{"content":" 🎮 PlayStation 2 ⏳ 14 hours ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)\nCinematic Time-Travel Finale #This game is a stylish and ambitious conclusion to the Onimusha trilogy, blending samurai-era Japan with modern-day Paris through an unexpected but entertaining time-travel storyline.

One of the standout features is the pet companion, which can not only assist in combat but also carry items back to town to sell, streamlining inventory management and improving the game\u0026rsquo;s progression pacing.\nStory and Replayability #The story is serviceable but not a major focus, taking a backseat to the loot and action. Overall, Torchlight is a polished and addictive ARPG that delivers a satisfying experience, especially for fans of Diablo-style games. Its simplicity, charm, and replayability make it a standout indie title from its time.\n","date":"17 June 2025","permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/posts/torchlight/","section":"Posts","summary":"A charming and fast-paced action RPG, featuring several developers who previously worked on the Diablo series.","title":"Torchlight"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://krauzer94.github.io/backblog-reviews/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
