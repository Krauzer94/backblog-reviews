## Birth of Metroidvania
This title is a genre-defining masterpiece that revolutionized the Castlevania series, departing from the linear level-based structure of its predecessors, it introduced a sprawling, interconnected castle map filled with secrets, RPG elements, and non-linear exploration, a blueprint for what would later be dubbed the "Metroidvania" genre. The protagonist this time is Alucard, Dracula’s son, navigating fluid combat, tight controls, and a richly gothic atmosphere enhanced by the unforgettable soundtrack. The game mixes platforming, item collection, and character progression seamlessly, while the English voice acting is famously campy, it adds to the game's charm.

## A Castle Without End
I never managed to beat this game when I first played it, because I thought it's map was very confusing, but after learning english I managed to trick myself into thinking that I beat it after reaching the half-way of the game. When I realized there would be a whole new game after the "credits", that is when I knew this video-game is one of the best of all time, and a truly unique experience, from start to finish, I can't recommend this enough as a must-play on all of the platforms it was released up until today.
