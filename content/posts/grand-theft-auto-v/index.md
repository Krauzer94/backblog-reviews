## Three Lives, One City
The fifth GTA title is an ambitious open-world action game that masterfully blends storytelling, satire, and chaos. Set in the sprawling, sun-soaked city of Los Santos and its surrounding countryside, the game lets you switch between three distinct protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each offering a different perspective on crime, greed, and personal dysfunction.

## A Living Open World
This was not a very unique narrative trait at the time, but the standout was how lived-in the surrounding world of these characters was, and that you could switch between them on-the-fly, this was a very unique gameplay feature. The PC version shines with enhanced graphics, a first-person mode, and mod support, delivering smooth performance and breathtaking visuals for its time.

## Personal Playstyle Focus
Particularly I never used any mods and I focused on finishing the main story, while also playing a couple of side-missions. Though I highly recommend experimenting since the modding community is still strong on this one every it's PC release, yet to this day, the same level of something like Fallout, STALKER and Elder Scrolls.

## Content Beyond Story
The game's missions are varied and cinematic, while side activities and dynamic events keep the world feeling alive. Its multiplayer mode, GTA Online, has grown into a juggernaut of content and chaos, though again, this was not something I experienced very much, but I recognize it's quality, regardless of my experience with it.

## A Modern Classic
This is a modern classic, GTA V is a technical and narrative milestone that still holds up remarkably well. By far, the best thing about this title, in my opinion, are the three main characters, Rockstar really focused on making the most unique story-line up until this point. This is one of the best games of all time, and I highly recommend not skipping it, on any platform possible.
