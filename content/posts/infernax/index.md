## Retro Action Revival
This title is a retro-inspired action platformer by Berzerk Studio that pays homage to classics like Castlevania II and Zelda II. The MC is called Alcedor, a knight returning home to find his land consumed by demonic corruption. The game’s pixel art, chiptune soundtrack, and grim tone perfectly capture the feel of 8-bit era games while adding a touch of modern polish. Its tight combat, brutal difficulty, and exploration-heavy structure make it both challenging and rewarding for players who enjoy mastering precise mechanics and uncovering secrets.

## Meaningful Morality Choices
What makes Infernax stand out is its morality system, which allows you to make choices that affect quests, story outcomes, and even the game’s endings. This layer of consequence adds replayability and gives depth to what could otherwise be a straightforward retro homage. Each decision feels weighty, and the different paths encourage multiple playthroughs. The game also features optional modern assists, such as easier difficulty modes and save points, making it more accessible than many of the old-school titles it emulates.

## Old-School Challenge Returns
This may sound like a strange thing to mention since most titles nowadays have these features as standards, but back in the day, you almost always needed to play the whole game in a sitting, or rely on passwords of some kind. However, this game can be punishing early on, with tough enemies and unforgiving platforming sections that may frustrate less patient people. Some design elements intentionally mimic the clunky quirks of older games, which might not appeal to everyone, fortunately for me, this is not a big deal. Still, its fair challenge, variety of secrets, and excellent atmosphere make it one of the better examples of modern retro gaming.

## Nostalgic Adventure Must-Play
For fans of classic action-adventure games who crave a blend of nostalgia, grit, and meaningful choices, this game is a must-play. It is one of the best of it's kind, and I'm biased since I'm a fan of this style. I also recommend diving into it's easter eggs, it starts pretty early, even when choosing your MC's name can affect the gameplay entirely, changing your default weapon and look, drastically changing how you play the game, it is a fun experience to try and replay using other names and playstyles.
