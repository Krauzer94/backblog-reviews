## Animated Jazz Aesthetic
This game is a run-and-gun indie gem that immediately stands out thanks to its striking 1930s cartoon art style. Every frame is hand-drawn and paired with a lively jazz and ragtime soundtrack, making the game feel like you’re playing inside an old animated short. This level of craftsmanship gives it a unique identity that very few games have achieved, and this is especially awesome for people that lived this era in cartoon history, with characters such as the Disney ones from the Mickey universe.

## Relentless Boss Battles
As for the gameplay, it is focused on intense boss battles, sprinkled with some platforming stages. Each boss has multiple phases, with unpredictable and creative attacks that keep you on your toes. The controls are responsive and precise, which is crucial because the game is notoriously difficult. Success often comes after many failed attempts, making victories especially satisfying. While the formula is not particularly unique and original, it is masterfully executed, the bosses and stages are very memorable and you'll for sure know what you are facing even after lots of subsequent plays.

## Punishing Skill Test
The difficulty, however, can be polarizing, some players will find the relentless challenge frustrating, while others will appreciate it as a test of patience and skill, particularly I enjoyed it's hard nature since I'm inclined to these kinds of games. The game does offer a “Simple” mode, but full completion requires taking on the standard, more punishing versions of bosses. Overall, Cuphead is more than just a tough game, it’s a work of art, its blend of retro aesthetics, tight gameplay, and rewarding challenge makes it one of the most memorable indie releases of the last decade.

## A Modern Classic
This is a visually stunning, musically vibrant, and brutally challenging run-and-gun that’s perfect if you enjoy mastering difficult games. I got to admit that I've never finished the DLC but I highly recommend doing so, there is no excuse, is more content for people who enjoyed it. But it won't win you over, quite the contrary, it is a much more difficult content compared to the base game, I couldn't beat the final boss for example. Another standout is the coop experience, which I could only manage to play the DLC, but not the base game. This is truly one of the best games I've ever played, to the same level of other videogame classics, don't sleep on this.
