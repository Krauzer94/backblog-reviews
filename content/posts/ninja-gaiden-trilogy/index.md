## Classic Ninja Collection
This title bundles together the three NES titles, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, and Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom, into a single cartridge. On paper, it sounds like the perfect way to experience Ryu Hayabusa’s saga on newer hardware. The fast-paced action, wall-climbing, and signature cinematic cutscenes that made the series famous are all still here, preserving the tough but rewarding gameplay.

## Inferior SNES Port
However, the compilation is often considered disappointing. The SNES port features simplified visuals, weaker sound effects, and reworked music that loses some of the sharp energy of the originals. Certain cutscene animations were cut, further reducing the impact of the story presentation. While the challenge and core mechanics remain intact, the collection feels stripped down compared to the NES versions.

## Convenient Yet Flawed
For newcomers, it offers a convenient way to play all three games in one place, but for long-time fans, it lacks the polish and intensity that defined the originals, making it more of a curiosity than the definitive version. I can't recommend this title enough if you like hard games, or action platformers in general, but if you have a hard time dealing with frustration then I recommend staying away from this one, since it is very punishing, and very unfair.
