## Retro-Futuristic Terror
This Alien title is a first-person survival horror game set in the universe of Ridley Scott’s universe. It captures the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the 1979 film with incredible attention to detail, from the industrial corridors of the Sevastopol space station to the eerie lighting and sound design. The atmosphere is tense and oppressive, making every moment feel unsettling.

## The Perfect Stalker
The Alien itself is the game’s standout feature. Its unpredictable AI ensures it constantly stalks the player, reacting to noise and movement in ways that keep encounters frightening and fresh. And eve to this day, this AI is very impressive, nothing really matches this, despite it being focused on horror titles, and for a stalker enemy, this is still an impressive technical marvel in the gaming industry as a whole.

## Tension and Frustration
Hiding in lockers, holding your breath, and nervously watching the motion tracker create some of the most memorable and terrifying moments in modern horror gaming. However, the experience is not without flaws. The campaign can feel overly long, with sections that repeat similar fetch-quest mechanics and slow pacing that sometimes dilutes the tension. The manual save system can add to the stress, as death often forces you to replay long stretches.

## A Horror Classic
Despite these drawbacks, this game remains a standout horror title on PC. It offers a faithful and chilling adaptation of the Alien universe, rewarding patience and careful play with some of the most immersive scares the genre has to offer. It is definitely one of the best horror games of all time, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.
