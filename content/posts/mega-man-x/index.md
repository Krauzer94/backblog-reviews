## Revitalized Classic Gameplay
This Capcom title is a landmark action-platformer that successfully revitalized the classic Mega Man formula for the 16-bit era, it introduced faster gameplay, wall-jumping, hidden upgrades, and a darker, more mature story set in a futuristic world of "Maverick" robots, and in my opinion, a way more superior version of the classic Mega Man. The game excels with tight controls, a memorable soundtrack, and dynamic level design that subtly changes based on the order you defeat bosses, this is one of it's most unique mechanics.

## Unique Level Mechanics
Visually, it pushed the SNES hardware with vibrant sprite work and smooth animations. I can't stress this enough when I say this video-game has one of the best OSTs in gaming history, each and every song is better than the last, this is truly one of it's main strengths, and this also sets the bar very high for the other entries in the series. Overall, Mega Man X is a masterclass in platforming and one of the most beloved entries in the series. A must-play for fans of retro action games, definitely one of the best games of all time, and one of the best of the SNES platform.
