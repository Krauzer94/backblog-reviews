## Old-School FPS Roots
The third Serious Sam entry is a FPS that aims to deliver old-school, high-octane action. Developed by Croteam and published by Devolver Digital, it features massive waves of enemies and a large arsenal of weapons, so no news on this regard, it works similarly as the previous entries in the frachise. I confess that this one was my first game of this series, I've never played the previous ones, eve though I'm a big fan of oldschool shooters such as Doom, Quake and alike.

## Overwhelming Combat Loop
On paper, the relentless combat and fast-paced gameplay sound appealing, but in practice, it quickly becomes overwhelming and repetitive. The level design emphasizes constant fighting over any meaningful narrative or variety, which made it hard for me to stay engaged. The sheer volume of enemies and chaotic encounters felt more exhausting than exciting, and the game didn’t offer enough moments to catch a breath or feel a sense of progression.

## A Mid Entry
Despite the game’s nods to classic FPS mechanics, I couldn’t get past the first six hours, as the repetitive action and lack of depth made it hard to maintain interest. Overall, Serious Sam 3: BFE may appeal to fans of relentless, old-school shooters, but for me, it fell short of sustaining engagement, leaving the experience more tiring than enjoyable. I would only recommend this one if you are a hardcore fan of the series, because it seems that it is common sense that this one was a mid entry.
