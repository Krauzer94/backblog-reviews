## Immersive Sci-Fi Horror
This videogame is a masterclass in sci-fi survival horror, set aboard the derelict spaceship USG Ishimura, the MC this time is an engineer called Isaac Clarke, battling grotesque "Necromorphs" and uncovering a chilling conspiracy, so a very unique MC compared to all the other military-oriented ones we had in the past. The game combines tight third-person shooting, atmospheric tension, and minimal UI design to create a deeply immersive experience, and for me the UI is a standout since it is very unique compared to what we had up until that point, and yet today we don't see this much attention put into making a unique navigation menu, which is a shame.

## Sound-Driven Terror
Its haunting audio design, strategic dismemberment combat, and oppressive environments make it a standout of the genre, in my opinion the sounds are what makes this game scary, it has a very grotesque tone to it, making you panic even though nothing is happening, and I know I'm not alone on this one. Despite some backtracking and stiff character movement, it's still a gripping and terrifying journey worth experiencing, not to mention it has a very bold story for a first entry, the ending is something I'll never forget, and definitely the most unique one out of all the other entries.
