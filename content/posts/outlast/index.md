## Horror Asylum Mystery
This title is a first-person survival horror game that quickly became a modern benchmark for the genre. The MC is called Miles Upshur, who ventures into the remote and foreboding Mount Massive Asylum after receiving a mysterious tip about unethical experiments. Armed with nothing but a camcorder, Miles must navigate blood-soaked corridors, avoid deranged inmates, and uncover the horrific truth lurking within the facility.

## Vulnerable Survival Tension
The game’s most distinctive feature is its commitment to vulnerability, there are no weapons, no combat, and no way to fight back. Instead, survival depends on running, hiding, and conserving battery power for the camcorder’s night vision, which adds a chilling green tint to every shadowy encounter. The sound design amplifies the terror, with distant screams, echoing footsteps, and heavy breathing pulling players deeper into the asylum’s suffocating atmosphere.

## Relentless Atmospheric Terror
Visually, this game delivers claustrophobic environments dripping with decay and dread, enhanced by realistic lighting that makes every flickering bulb a source of anxiety. While some of its scares rely heavily on repetition and jump shocks, the sheer intensity of its pacing and the oppressive tone sustain the fear throughout. As a debut title, it excels at delivering pure, adrenaline-fueled horror, a raw and terrifying experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark.
