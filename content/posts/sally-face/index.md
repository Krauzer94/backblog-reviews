## Episodic Horror Mystery
This title is a dark, episodic indie adventure game, the MC is called Sal Fisher, a boy with a prosthetic face mask who moves into a new apartment complex and quickly becomes involved in a murder mystery. It starts off almost immediately asking you to accept all these weird things happening, and the world the characters live in. Over five episodes, the game shifts from eerie slice-of-life exploration into psychological and supernatural horror, weaving a narrative that balances emotional depth with disturbing imagery.

## Nightmarish Atmosphere
The game’s strongest point is its atmosphere, its hand-drawn art style mixes colorful cartoonish visuals with grotesque and surreal moments, creating a mood that feels both innocent and nightmarish. The soundtrack, combines ambient soundscapes with moody rock and synth elements, adding a haunting quality that stays with you long after playing.

## Simple Yet Clever Gameplay
Gameplay is straightforward, mostly involving exploration, dialogue, and puzzle solving. While some puzzles are clever, others can feel obscure and require careful note-taking. The inclusion of retro-style mini-games through Sal’s handheld “Gear Boy” device adds variety, though some players feel these sequences occasionally disrupt the pacing. Despite these minor frustrations, Sally Face has been widely praised for its originality and emotional storytelling.

## Cult Horror Classic
It grew into a cult hit, admired for its ability to make players feel uneasy, intrigued, and emotionally invested in its characters. For fans of narrative-driven indie games with horror and mystery elements, it remains a standout experience. I consider it one of the best of it's kind. It is truly one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in gaming, especially because it is not shy to show, and do, some gruesome things other games would never imagine, similar to something like Fear and Hunger, another amazing horror game.
