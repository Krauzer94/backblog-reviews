## Identity-Driven Puzzle Mechanics
This game is an atmospheric puzzle-platformer, set on a mysterious and abandoned research station. Its central mechanic revolves around a device that allows you to create clones of yourself and swap your consciousness between them, leading to puzzles that are both clever and thematically tied to questions of identity and existence. At first I thought it would have a complex story, with mysteries, interpretative sections and some characters, but in the end it is just a pretext for the gameplay, nothing more than that.

## Haunting Artistic Presentation
The game’s handmade clay and model-based art style, combined with eerie lighting and ambient sound, gives it a haunting, otherworldly feel that perfectly matches its philosophical tone. The puzzles escalate in complexity with mechanics like light restrictions and gravity, keeping the challenge engaging without overwhelming the player. I confess that I struggled a lot in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, mid-way through, it becomes a breeze and a very satisfying puzzle game experience.

## Focused Cryptic Experience
While relatively short, about four hours, the game’s brevity works in its favor, maintaining a focused experience that blends cerebral puzzle-solving with thought-provoking narrative elements. Its story is deliberately cryptic, inviting interpretation, and it resonates strongly with people who enjoy games that explore deeper themes of consciousness and humanity. So if you enjoy this kind of plot, which can be a very obscure one, and lacking a lot of explanation deliberately, this is one of the best games you can play.

## Interpretative Yet Memorable
I would argue this game has a bad story simply because it is lacking a lot, but in the end, since this is a very interpretative story, I cannot really say this, what I can say is that sometimes it can feel cheap on this regard, relying too much on it's more interpretative nature. Overall, this is a striking indie title, praised for its originality, mood, and puzzle design. It remains memorable as much for its philosophical weight as for its clever gameplay, making it an excellent choice for fans of atmospheric and contemplative experiences.
