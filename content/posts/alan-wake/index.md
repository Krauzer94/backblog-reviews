## Dark Narrative Thriller
Alan Wake is a gripping psychological thriller that combines atmospheric storytelling with action gameplay. The MC is a bestselling author who finds himself trapped in a surreal nightmare where darkness is a literal enemy, needing to fights his own creations. The game's episodic format, reminiscent of a TV series, adds to the suspense and keeps the narrative tightly focused. And this was a standout at the time, similar to how Max Payne handled story-telling using comicbook styles cutscenes.

## Atmosphere and Storytelling
Its storytelling is the highlight, filled with mystery, eerie small-town vibes, and metafictional twists that blur the line between fiction and reality, inspired by oldschool TV shows. Visually, the game was striking for its time, especially in its use of lighting and shadow, which also plays a key role in combat, even for the standards ad the time, the effects were very well developed.

## Light, Combat, Legacy
The light-based combat mechanic is unique, but the gameplay loop can feel repetitive over longer sessions, though since this is considered a survival horror title. It is not that bad since combat is not at the same level of something like a traditional shooter. Still, the atmosphere and story more than make up for it. And overall, this is a standout experience for fans of narrative-driven horror and suspense, offering a compelling blend of action and psychological drama.
