## Choice-Driven Mojave RPG
Fallout: New Vegas is a deeply unique and immersive post-apocalyptic RPG, set in the Mojave Wasteland, it expands on Fallout 3's gameplay with improved faction dynamics, branching storylines, and a strong emphasis on player choice. The writing is sharp, which was, and still is, one of the most memorable aspects of this title, still praised to this day by the community as one of the best worlds, story-lines, and especially, the best characters of any RPG videogame.

## Rich World, Lasting Mods
The world-building rich, and the atmosphere unmistakably Fallout, dark, quirky, and full of moral ambiguity, which, similarly to the previous entry, every decision matters from the very start of the game. While it launched with technical bugs, many were later patched or fixed by the modding community, which is still going strong even to this day, sometimes even creating whole new games, with new worlds, characters and stories, developed upon the base of this amazing title.

## A Timeless RPG Classic
New Vegas remains a cult classic thanks to its narrative depth, memorable characters, and freedom to shape the world around you. This is a flawed gem that offers one of the most engaging role-playing experiences in the Fallout series. This is truly one of the best videogames ever made, immensely recognized by the gaming industry, the community, and by all games which were inspired by it, and I highly recommend playing this any way possible, don't skip it if you like RPGs to any extent.
