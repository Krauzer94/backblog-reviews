## Stylish Combat Mastery
The 5th Devil May Cry entry is a stylish return to form for the series, delivering some of the most satisfying Hack'N Slash combat in the genre. The three playable characters, Nero, Dante, and the newcomer "V". Each bring unique mechanics that keep gameplay fresh, with Nero’s Devil Breakers adding variety, Dante’s deep style system offering unmatched versatility, and V’s pet-based combat introducing a slower but tactical option. Particularly I was not a fan of V, but once you get the hang of him you fall in love with his playstyle, Capcom really is amazingly creative when creating unique characters such as those.

## RE Engine Spectacle
Visually, the game shines thanks to Capcom’s RE Engine, boasting detailed character models, flashy effects, and smooth performance on PC. This shows how amazing and flexible the engine can be, creating gruesome survival horror titles such as the RE Remakes (and also the first-person ones) and also intense action games such as DMC. Boss fights are a highlight, combining cinematic spectacle with challenging mechanics, while the soundtrack complements the action with energetic flair, so no big news here, this is still "Devil May Cry"-level of quality.

## Flawed Yet Essential
On the downside, the level design is often repetitive, with corridors and arenas that feel less inspired compared to the combat itself, though particularly I was never a big an of the exploration on this franchise anyway, so not a big deal for me. The story, though serviceable and filled with fan-pleasing moments, leans heavily into cheesy dialogue and can feel thin for newcomers. Some gameplay quirks, like limited camera control and the restrictive Devil Breaker system, also drew criticism. Overall, Devil May Cry 5 is a thrilling, polished, and over-the-top action game. Its stylish combat and replayability far outweigh its flaws, making it a must-play for fans of fast-paced action and anyone seeking a modern Hack'N Slash experience.
