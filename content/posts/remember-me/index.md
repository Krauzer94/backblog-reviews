## Cyberpunk Memory Concept
Remember Me is a stylish action-adventure game set in a futuristic, cyberpunk version of Paris. The MC is called Nilin, a memory hunter with the power to remix and steal memories, which forms the game's most unique mechanic. The world design is striking, and the concept of memory manipulation is intriguing, though underused.

## Wasted Core Mechanic
Which is unfortunately since this was the most unique aspect of this game, and yet, they decided to inflate it's length by adding layers upon layers of regular combat, and while the combat feels satisfying, resembling something like the Batman Arkham series, it is still very repetitive in the long run.

## Style Over Substance
Combat is fluid but repetitive, relying on customizable combo chains. The story is decent but occasionally stumbles in pacing and character depth, and since the main mechanic of the story was misused, this brings it's value even lower. While it doesn't fully live up to its potential, Remember Me stands out for its atmosphere, visuals, and ambition.
