## Frustrating Difficulty Design
I really wanted to like this one, but I quit half-way through, it is simply not as fun as as engaging as it is trying to be, the difficulty is simply ridiculous, it may look like it is skill-based, but it is actually luck based, there is no telling how the enemies will behave. Not to mention the annoying infinite respawns, this is supposed to make the game fast-paced and give you a sense or urgency, but it is just tiring, you don't have the proper time to learn how to master the several different weapons (they are actually quite fun to use) because there is either not enough ammo because of the infinite respawns, or enough time, to familiarize yourself with them, the boss levels are the most frustrating ones.

## Unfair Enemy Mechanics
I really don't recommend this one, not even if you abuse save-states or have a friend to play along, there are plenty other games to enjoy in coop, this is simply not one of them. But there is one thing that I really like about it, and that is it's style in general, it is very charming, the musics, animations, everything, it is very high quality. I got to admit that this game scared me as a kid, it's sound design is very creepy in my opinion, and even today, as an adult, I still think it is a very creepy sound design, but at least it doesn't scare me anymore haha though some monsters still look gross as hell.
