## Definitive Mario Collection
This game bundle is a stellar compilation that brings together four classic NES Mario titles, Super Mario Bros 1, 2, 3, and The Lost Levels, with enhanced 16-bit graphics, updated music, and a save feature, which helped a lot on the more challenging Mario titles. The visual upgrade adds polish without losing the charm of the originals, and the inclusion of The Lost Levels (previously unreleased outside Japan) offers a fresh challenge. It’s both a nostalgic tribute and an excellent entry point for new players. Overall, it’s a definitive Mario package that stands as one of the best remakes/collections of its time.

## SMB3 Standout Experience
Since this title has a lot of games inside it, I got to admit that I focused on the best ones, and these are the ones that I have the most to say, which is basically the third title haha not gonna lie it is way better than the other ones, at least in my opinion. So I mostly play this one in order to play SMB 3 on the SNES, because I never had the chance to do so on the NES, but I highly recommend checking the other titles out, since you can't go wrong with old 2D Mario, is just that this one offers a way better experience because of the modernized features such as being able to save your progress.
