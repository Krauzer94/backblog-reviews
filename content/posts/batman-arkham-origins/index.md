## Early Arkham Origins
The second entry for the Batman: Arkham series is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum. Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a younger, less experienced Batman facing assassins hired by Black Mask, while also exploring his first encounters with iconic villains like the Joker. On the plus side, the game retains the core Arkham formula, fluid combat, stealth predator encounters, and a sprawling Gotham to explore.

## Memorable Yet Repetitive
The story offers an interesting look at Batman’s early career, and the boss fights (especially Deathstroke) are among the series’ most memorable ones. However, it’s often considered the weakest entry: it reuses many assets from Arkham City, introduces few real innovations. The open world feels emptier compared to its predecessors, and some pacing drags.

## Solid but Skippable
No big news when it comes to how the game works, which is a huge step down when compared to Arkham City, which had an amazing open world experience. Overall, a solid but unremarkable entry, worth playing for fans of the Arkham series and Batman’s lore, but it doesn’t reach the polish and impact of Arkham Asylum or City. And while it is a skippaple title in my opinion, this is still a good videogame, just not a good Batman Arkham one.
