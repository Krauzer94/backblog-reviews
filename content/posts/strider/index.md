## Stylish Ninja Reboot
Strider is a fast-paced 2.5D action-platformer reboot of the classic arcade/NES series, developed by Double Helix Games. I got to admit, this was my first Strider game and I loved it, though not enough to make me want to play the older titles, as much as I am a retro gaming fan. The MC is called Hiryu, a futuristic ninja slicing through a dystopian city controlled by the villainous Grandmaster Meio. The game excels in fluid combat, responsive controls, and stylish traversal, blending hack-and-slash intensity with Metroidvania-inspired exploration.

## Short, Sharp Action
The bossfights are a standout to me, very cinematic, impressive and challenging. While the story is minimal and the environments can feel repetitive, the crisp visuals, tight gameplay loop, and satisfying upgrades make it a solid modern reinterpretation of a cult classic. Overall this makes up for a more interesting game for more modern audiences, and in my opinion, it's modernization was very well made and polished. It's short but sharp, ideal for fans of action and retro reboots, and action-platformers in general, one of the best that I've played of this genre.
