## Undead Revenge Unleashed
This title is a remaster of the 1997 cult-classic shooter Blood, by Nightdive Studios. It updates the original game with modern features like higher resolutions, widescreen support, smoother performance, and improved compatibility with current hardware, while keeping its signature fast-paced and gory gameplay intact. The MC is called Caleb, an undead gunslinger out for revenge, battling cultists, zombies, and grotesque monsters across a series of cleverly designed levels filled with secrets and dark humor.

## Faithful Blood Restoration
The game’s biggest strength lies in how faithfully it preserves the spirit of the original. Weapons like the flare gun, dynamite bundles, and the voodoo doll remain just as satisfying to use, and the level design still stands out as some of the best from the Build engine era. The atmosphere, blending horror, comedy, and chaotic action, holds up very well. It also bundles in the two official expansions, Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, offering plenty of content for both newcomers and returning fans.

## A Brutal Revival
I highly recommend playing these extra content, they are well worth it, despite the main game being somewhat longer than it needs to be, so maybe come back later to finish it another opportunity. However, not everything is perfect, you'll notice slight differences in movement, weapon behavior, and difficulty balance compared to the original version, making it feel “off” in subtle ways. Overall, this game is a successful revival of one of the best shooters of the 90s. It’s brutal, stylish, and has a lot of replay value, combining old-school charm with modern accessibility.

## Boomer Shooter Masterclass
This shooter is truly one of the best of it's kind, it's originality alone carry the game forward, even if you are not a fan of shooters. Despite it being considered a boomer shooter cult-classic nowadays, it has a varied way of playing it with the amount of different weapons you can play around with. Not to mention it's enemies and level design force you to be creative and use all of them in order to maximize your chance if not dying, because trust me, it'll happen a lot. For fans of retro FPS games, this is definitely a must-play, just expect a tough, unforgiving experience that stays true to its roots.
