## Undercover Stealth Tension
This entry offers a solid stealth experience with a unique twist: Sam Fisher goes undercover in a terrorist organization, forcing players to balance trust between the NSA and the enemy. While not as visually advanced as its Xbox 360/PC counterparts, the PS2 version tells a slightly different story and retains the classic Splinter Cell gameplay, sneaking through shadows, disabling enemies, and using high-tech gadgets. The game’s morality system adds tension, with choices affecting mission outcomes and endings, however.

## Limited Tech, Solid Entry
The aging hardware limits level complexity and visuals for today's standards, since even at the time it was already inferior the its counterparts. Still, it’s a gripping entry for fans of stealth action, with strong atmosphere and branching consequences, so no surprises here, it is still a solid Splinter Cell entry. While this one is not one of the best entries, and it is also a bit skippable, I recommend this one only if you are a fan of the Splinter Cell franchise, which is my case, otherwise, the other versions are superior if you want the best experience.
