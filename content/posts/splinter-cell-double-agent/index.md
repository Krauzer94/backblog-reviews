## Undercover Stealth Tension
This entry offers a solid stealth experience with a unique twist: Sam Fisher goes undercover in a terrorist organization, forcing players to balance trust between the NSA and the enemy. While not as visually advanced as its Xbox 360/PC counterparts, the PS2 version tells a slightly different story and retains the classic Splinter Cell gameplay, sneaking through shadows, disabling enemies, and using high-tech gadgets. The game’s morality system adds tension, with choices affecting mission outcomes and endings, however.

## Limited Tech, Solid Entry
The aging hardware limits level complexity and visuals for today's standards, since even at the time it was already inferior the its counterparts. Still, it’s a gripping entry for fans of stealth action, with strong atmosphere and branching consequences, so no surprises here, it is still a solid Splinter Cell entry. While this one is not one of the best entries, and it is also a bit skippable, I recommend this one only if you are a fan of the Splinter Cell franchise, which is my case, otherwise, the other versions are superior if you want the best experience.

## Measured Yet Limited
On the mechanical side, this version maintains the deliberate pacing the series is known for, though enemy AI can be inconsistent, occasionally breaking immersion. Controls remain tight and familiar, but some levels feel more constrained due to hardware limitations, reducing the freedom of approach seen in other versions. Checkpoint placement can also be unforgiving at times, which may frustrate newcomers, especially during longer stealth sequences that demand precision and patience.

## Choices Drive Replayability
Replay value is bolstered by the game’s branching choices and multiple endings, encouraging you to experiment with different moral paths. The OST and sound design deserve mention as well, as they do much of the heavy lifting in building tension, compensating for the visual downgrade. Overall, while this rendition isn’t the definitive way to experience this title, it still succeeds in delivering a tense, story-driven stealth experience that aligns well with the franchise’s core identity.
