## Evolving the Franchise
This title marked a major shift for the series, evolving from its fixed-camera survival-action roots into a more dynamic, action-RPG experience. The game introduced five playable characters, each with distinct abilities, weapons, and combat styles, encouraging you to switch between them to solve puzzles and tackle enemies strategically. The fully 3D environments and free camera control felt like a natural modernization of the franchise, offering greater freedom and immersion compared to the earlier games’ cinematic but restrictive design.

## Characters and Presentation
And while I admit I really liked the characters overall, in terms of personality and gameplay, there isn't really any reason to go in-depth with any of them. You can simply choose the one you liked the most and focus on making that one stronger, particularly I really liked Akane since I enjoy playing with nimble characters in general. Visually, the game stood out as one of the most polished titles on the PS2, with impressive graphics, detailed character models, and fluid animations. The cinematic cutscenes and orchestral soundtrack added a dramatic flair that matched its ambitious scope.

## Content and Story Flaws
It also offered far more content than previous entries, longer playtime, numerous side quests, and plenty of unlockables that gave it excellent replay value. This title really doesn't feel like it belongs to the Onimusha frachise, but in a good way, while at the same time, the all the classic enemies are in here, with slight changes in their visuals. However, Dawn of Dreams was not without flaws, the story, while expansive, suffered from uneven pacing and occasionally clunky dialogue that weakened its emotional impact.

## Difficulty and Repetition
Some people criticized the game for reusing enemies and assets from earlier titles, and the difficulty curve could be inconsistent, certain battles felt dragged out or overly punishing, while others were trivialized by abundant healing items. The previous titles had some spongy enemies and very long battles, but since this one introduced a lot of RPG mechanics, this escalated a lot, some fights are really tiring to go through, and some sections are unnecessarily difficult.

## Underrated Yet Influential
Despite these issues, this game remains an underappreciated gem in Capcom’s library. It pushed the series toward deeper mechanics and richer gameplay, even if it sacrificed some of the dark atmosphere and tight storytelling that defined its predecessors. For fans of action-adventure games on the PS2, or even just regular Hack'N Slash fans, it’s a a must-play of the Onimusha franchise.
