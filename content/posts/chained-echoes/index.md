## Modern JRPG Nostalgia
This title is a love letter to classic JRPGs, evoking the style of the SNES and PlayStation era while modernizing the experience with quality-of-life improvements. Its turn-based combat is built around the clever Overdrive system, which keeps battles dynamic by rewarding careful skill choices and punishing reckless play. The inclusion of mech-based encounters adds another layer of strategy and variety, keeping the game from feeling repetitive.

## Stunning Visuals & Sound
Visually, the game’s pixel art is beautiful, with richly detailed environments and fluid animations that complement its sweeping fantasy setting. The soundtrack is another highlight, often praised for its atmosphere and ability to capture the emotional tone of each scene. Content-wise, it’s a lengthy adventure filled with side quests, character interactions, and hidden secrets, offering anywhere from 30 to 50 hours of playtime.

## Story And Mechanics Flaws
Not everything lands perfectly, though. The story, while engaging, suffers from uneven pacing and some unresolved threads by the end. The Overdrive mechanic, while fresh, can at times feel restrictive, forcing you to make choices just to manage the meter rather than following their preferred strategies. The writing and localization occasionally stumble as well, leading to awkward dialogue in places.

## Indie JRPG Masterpiece
Despite these flaws, this game succeeds as one of the standout indie RPGs in recent years. It strikes a balance between nostalgia and innovation, providing fans of the genre with a heartfelt, content-rich experience that both respects its inspirations and establishes its own identity. I highly recommend this for fans of JRPGs in general, it is really one of the best indies you can find of this style, a must-play.
