## One-Hit Precision Combat
This indie title is a stylish 2D action-platformer that combines razor-sharp combat with a striking neo-noir aesthetic. The MC is a katana-wielding assassin who can slow down time and plan each move in deadly, fast-paced encounters where one hit means death for both you and your enemies. It sometimes feel like you are playing a side-scroller version of Hotline Miami since it is a hit-kill game with high difficulty levels.

## Hypnotic Neon Atmosphere
The game’s trial-and-error structure makes every level feel like a carefully choreographed dance of reflexes and precision. One of it's standout is the atmosphere, the neon-soaked pixel art, VHS-inspired effects, and pulsing synthwave soundtrack create an immersive, almost hypnotic mood. And while I'm very biased since I love synthwave, I can safely say that this is one of the best aspects of the game even for people that are not familiar with this aesthetic and/or music genre.

## Fragmented Psychological Narrative
Beyond the action, the narrative dives into psychological themes, using fragmented storytelling and surreal conversations that keep you guessing. While the story is engaging, it deliberately leaves some questions unanswered, which can feel frustrating but also adds to its mysterious allure. Although this may be an issue for a lot of people, this is a standout for me since I love this kind of story-telling, like I've said multiple times on other reviews, so if you are not into this aspect, I advise caution when it comes to the game's lore.

## Short But Impactful
The main drawback is its length, as the campaign can be completed in just a handful of hours, some people may also find the repetition of restarting sections tiring. Still, its slick presentation, intense gameplay, and bold narrative make it one of the most memorable indie action games of its decade. And while short, it has a very good replay value, overall this is one of the best indie titles that I've ever played, to the same level, and intent, of titles such as Hotline Miami, so don't skip this one if you find any of this even slightly interesting.
