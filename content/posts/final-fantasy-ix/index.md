## Return to Classic Fantasy
This Final Fantasy entry is a beautifully crafted love letter to the series’ origins, a heartfelt blend of medieval fantasy, charming characters, and profound storytelling. Developed by Square near the end of the original PlayStation’s life cycle, the game stands out for its return to classic Final Fantasy aesthetics after the more futuristic tones of VII and VIII.

## Deep, Emotional Characters
The MC is called Zidane, a roguish thief with a golden heart, who becomes entangled in a grand adventure alongside Princess Garnet, Vivi, and a colorful cast of allies. What begins as a lighthearted tale of kidnapping and rebellion soon evolves into an emotional exploration of identity, mortality, and the meaning of life. Each character faces personal struggles that give the narrative surprising emotional depth, particularly Vivi’s existential journey as a sentient black mage.

## Timeless RPG Gameplay
Gameplay stays true to the series’ roots, featuring turn-based battles and the Active Time Battle system, alongside a simple yet engaging ability-learning mechanic tied to equipment. Exploration across lush towns, mysterious dungeons, and a beautifully rendered world map gives a strong sense of adventure. The visuals, though limited by the PlayStation hardware, are charmingly stylized, with detailed pre-rendered backgrounds and expressive character designs that make the world feel alive.

## Masterful Musical Score
The OST is one of the finest in the franchise, from the whimsical “Melodies of Life” to haunting battle and world themes that elevate every scene’s emotional weight. While its pace can feel slower compared to later entries and the battle load times occasionally drag, this game is more than compensates with its warmth, humor, and timeless storytelling. It remains a standout entry, not only as a nostalgic farewell to the classic era of Final Fantasy, but also as one of the most soulful RPGs ever made.

## A Must-Play Classic
This is one of the best JRPGs, RPGs and Final Fantasy of all time, definitely a must-play for fans of the franchise, the genre or even if you even slightly like this kind of game. And although I don't consider this one to be the best Final Fantasy, it is for me very high up there. This is partially because I never had any nostalgic feeling towards the classic titles since I didn't played them back in the day when they were popular, but I can totally grasp the feeling of people that thinks this way.
