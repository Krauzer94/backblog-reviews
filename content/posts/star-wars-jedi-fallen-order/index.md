## Post-Order 66 Survival
This title is a single-player action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment that places players in the Star Wars universe shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith. The MC is called Cal Kestis, a young Jedi Padawan, as he struggles to survive while rebuilding the Jedi Order. The game delivers a strong narrative with emotional character interactions, particularly between Cal and his droid companion, BD-1. It really tries to make you like the characters involved in the plot, but I find it hard to like them, in general they are not quite as likable as other similar to most narrative Sony titles, for example, which has a similar approach to their characters.

## Challenging Exploration Combat
The combat system is precise and challenging, emphasizing timing, strategy, and mastery of both lightsaber duels and Force abilities. Exploration is a key component, with interconnected worlds that encourage backtracking with new abilities to uncover secrets and fully experience each planet. This Metroidvania-style design makes progression rewarding and keeps players engaged throughout the adventure. Some people even consider this a Soulslike due to it's difficulty level, and while I agree with this, I also think this is more of an adventure title, than an RPG one, since it's RPG mechanics are way more limited than the traditional Soulslike, which you can experiment with different builds.

## Authentic Yet Familiar
While the game excels in atmosphere and Star Wars authenticity, it has minor drawbacks. Some technical issues, such as inconsistent parrying mechanics and occasional frame drops, can disrupt the flow of combat. The story, although engaging, occasionally follows familiar Star Wars tropes, which may feel predictable to some players. Overall, this game is a captivating experience that successfully blends exploration, challenging combat, and narrative. Its immersive world and compelling gameplay make it a must-play for Star Wars fans and action-adventure enthusiasts alike.
