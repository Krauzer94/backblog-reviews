## Whimsical Disney Platforming
This is a charming and colorful platformer, one of the many Disney titles developed by Capcom at the time, and the first of them that I played in the SNES platform. Unlike its Sega Genesis counterpart, this version focuses more on agility and puzzle-like platforming than combat. Aladdin runs, jumps, and dodges through beautifully animated levels inspired by the film. The tight controls, whimsical music, and faithful art direction make it a standout SNES title, especially for younger audiences.

## Polished Yet Accessible
While it’s a bit easier than other platformers of the era, its polish and personality shine through, it is still a magical experience, if not the most challenging. Though it certainly has some challenging sections, it is not really as hard as other games that inspired it, even ones that were also developed by Capcom at the time.
