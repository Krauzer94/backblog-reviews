## Cyberpunk Freedom and Choice
Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a compelling cyberpunk RPG that blends stealth, action, and narrative choice with style. Set in a gritty near-future world obsessed with human augmentation, the MC is called Adam Jensen, a brooding ex-cop turned security specialist. The game excels in atmosphere, world-building, and giving players freedom in how they approach objectives, sneak, hack, talk, or go in guns blazing. While the story can be a bit dense and the boss fights are notoriously out of place (even being able to soft-lock you because of some bad designs), the experience as a whole is immersive and rewarding.

## Personalized Augmented RPG
Although sometimes it feels like an immersive sim of some sorts, this is really more of a RPG title, you can really build your own version of the perfect augmented agent, with your own unique gameplay traits. This was the first Deus Ex title that I've ever played, and I intend to play other ones too since I'm a big fan of both immersive sims and RPGs in general. This is definitely a standout for fans of thoughtful, choice-driven gameplay, and as already said, RPGs in general, especially if you are a cyberpunk fan like myself.
