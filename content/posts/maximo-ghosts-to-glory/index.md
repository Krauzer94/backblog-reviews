## Challenging Action-Platformer Revival
This title is an action-platformer that serves as a spiritual successor to Ghosts ’n Goblins. The game challenges you with tight combat, precise platforming, and a high difficulty level that rewards persistence and skill. Its core mechanics of sword combat, armor management, and exploration are solid, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment when progressing through tough levels. I admit that I abused the save-state feature in order to complete and 100% this one, no shame since it is an insanely punishing title, similar to it's predecessor.

## Charming Visuals and Sound
The visual style is charming, with colorful environments, skeletal enemies, and a humorous armor system where Maximo loses his armor after taking damage. It really makes you feel like you are playing a 3D version of the 2D titles from the previous console generations, this shows that you can still retain a consistent art-style despite the technology being used. The game’s presentation adds personality and keeps the action engaging, while the sound design and music complement the old-school arcade feel. The game also encourages replayability due to its challenging nature and strategic item usage, I advise this title is played 100% because of it's short length, despite it stretching it because of it's difficulty level.

## Difficulty and Design Flaws
However, the high difficulty can be punishing, especially for modern people used to frequent checkpoints and forgiving gameplay (easily solved by using save-states). Some camera angles and control quirks occasionally make combat and platforming frustrating, and the level design, while competent, can feel repetitive after extended play. Despite these issues, the challenge and nostalgic design make it appealing to fans of retro-inspired action games. Overall, this game is a rewarding experience for people who enjoy old-school difficulty and precise platforming. It is a standout PS2 title for those seeking a challenging adventure with personality, even if it demands patience and skill to fully appreciate.
