## Charming Disney Platformer
This title is a charming and visually impressive platformer developed by Capcom. The game follows Mickey on a quest to rescue Pluto from the evil Emperor Pete, featuring colorful graphics, tight controls, and imaginative level design. One standout feature is Mickey’s ability to change outfits, each granting him unique powers, like a firefighter suit or a wizard robe, and this is a recycled mechanic through other similar titles for the Capcom's Disney franchise. I was especially amazed by the abilities of the costumes since there were a lot of similar titles to play at the time, and you never knew which costumes, abilities and challenges the games would provide, very unique. While it’s a bit short and relatively easy, especially for experienced players, its polished presentation and Disney magic make it a memorable classic for fans of 16-bit platformers.
