## Dante’s Stylish Rebirth
This game is a stylish, fast-paced action game that revitalized the series after the poorly received DMC2, which in my opinion was not all that bad, is just that the third entry is galaxies away better. As a prequel, it explores the origins of Dante and his rivalry with his twin brother Vergil, the game is known for its punishing difficulty, deep combat system, and over-the-top style, even though most games of this genre had these traits, this one is a big standout, which says a lot.

## Deep, Demanding Combat
One unique mechanic is that Dante can switch between multiple combat styles (like Swordmaster or Gunslinger), adding tons of variety and replayability, since you can level up these skills. The boss fights are intense, it introduced some of the best bosses in gaming history, even for today's standards.

## Style, Sound, Legacy
The music is adrenaline-pumping, I consider this one of the best OSTs of all time. And the story, while melodramatic, fits the game’s gothic tone, best part for me are the characters, they are very charismatic compared to the more bland ones of the previous titles. Visually, it pushed the PS2 impressively, this is a challenging but rewarding game that helped define the Hack'N Slash genre, I highly recommend playing the more modern re-releases though.
