## Brutal War Campaigns
The game drops you into the Pacific and Eastern Front campaigns, letting you experience the brutality of jungle warfare against Japanese soldiers and the push into Berlin against a desperate German army, I love both of them and can't really decide which one I like the most. The single-player campaign is cinematic and dramatic, featuring well-designed missions, a darker tone, and a powerful soundtrack that underscores the chaos of battle, this is a way more brutal and visual game than the previous titles, specially when compared to the modern entries. I can't really talk much about the competitive online multiplayer since I have never played it at the time, but it also introduced Nazi Zombies, a surprisingly addictive survival mode that quickly became a fan-favorite and a permanent fixture in future titles, and this one I played a lot since you could get into this mode without an internet connection. Some players may find it a bit restrictive or simplistic by today’s standards, and the game’s age shows in its graphics and scripting, nevertheless, this is a raw, atmospheric, and challenging shooter that successfully captured the brutality of the conflict and paved the way for many future innovations in the franchise.
