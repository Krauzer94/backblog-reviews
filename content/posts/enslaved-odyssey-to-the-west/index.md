## Journey Reimagined
This videogame is a visually rich and emotionally engaging action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world reclaimed by nature. Loosely inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West (same base as the Dragon Ball anime series), it follows the journey of Monkey and Trip, two unlikely companions forced to rely on each other for survival. The game shines through its strong character development, the best part for e is really the characters themselves, even more than the story, impressive motion-capture performances, and cinematic presentation.

## Heart Beyond Mechanics
While the combat and platforming are fairly straightforward and sometimes repetitive. The heartfelt narrative and unique setting make it a memorable experience despite some technical flaws on the PC port. I highly recommend not skipping this one, took me a while to finally give it a chance, and after playing it I knew why it was so praised, truly one of the best action-adventure titles of all time.
