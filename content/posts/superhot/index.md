## Time as Puzzle
The first Superhot entry is a FPS that completely rethinks how the genre works. Its standout mechanic is that time only progresses when you move, which transforms each firefight into a tense and strategic puzzle. Instead of reacting on pure reflex, you’re constantly analyzing enemy positions, dodging incoming bullets in slow motion, and deciding the most efficient way to use whatever weapons or objects are nearby. I would only recommend this title for people who likes puzzles, but not necessarily shooters, this may sound strange, but it makes all the sense once you start playing.

## Style, Strategy, Meta
The result is a game that feels both cerebral and cinematic, giving you moments that look like choreographed action sequences but are really the product of careful planning. The minimalist art style, stark white environments with bright red enemies, isn’t just visually striking, it also reinforces clarity and focus in the chaos. The campaign itself is relatively short, but tightly designed and memorable, with a strange meta-narrative that blurs the line between player and game. If you like alternative story-telling then this is one of the best titles you can get, and if not, the only thing you'll enjoy here is the gameplay since there is not really a big plot with characters, dialogs and any traditional elements.

## Replayable Innovation
After finishing the story, endless and challenge modes provide plenty of replayability, encouraging you to refine your strategies and experiment with different playstyles. While some may find the length of the main story underwhelming, the game’s originality, atmosphere, and addictive gameplay loop make it stand out as one of the most innovative shooters of its era. This is one of the best puzzle (or even shooter) game that I've ever played and a must-play if you like these genres to any extent.
