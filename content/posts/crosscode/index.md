## Combat Meets Puzzles
This title is a retro-inspired action RPG that combines fast-paced combat with clever puzzle design. Set within the framework of a fictional MMORPG, it offers a unique narrative hook while delivering a single-player experience. The game shines with its fluid combat system, which blends melee and ranged attacks and incorporates elemental powers to keep encounters dynamic and engaging. Its puzzles, often physics-based and requiring precise aim or timing, are equally rewarding, though sometimes they can feel overly demanding.

## Pixel Art Excellence
Visually, CrossCode is a treat for fans of 16-bit aesthetics, featuring detailed pixel art and smooth animations that evoke the best of SNES-era RPGs, even resembling classic JRPG art-styles. The soundtrack enhances the atmosphere with energetic and emotional tracks, complementing both intense battles and quieter moments of exploration, and again, similar to JRPGs, the soundtrack is one of it's standouts.

## Exceptional Side Quests
The world itself is expansive, filled with dungeons, quests, and secrets that encourage thorough exploration, giving players dozens of hours of content to uncover. This is one of the best games when it comes to it's side-quests, very few games makes me want to play all of them. And I dare to say this has the same level of quality of the Final Fantasy XII hunting side-quests, which it really makes you want to find all the prays and complete all the side-quests related to them.

## Ambition and Pacing
On the downside, the game’s pacing can occasionally falter, some dungeons feel overly long, and certain puzzles may test patience with their precision requirements. The story, while intriguing, takes its time to build momentum, which might not suit players looking for a more immediate narrative payoff. Despite these issues, CrossCode remains a standout indie RPG, praised for its polish, depth, and the way it captures the spirit of classic games while adding modern twists.

## Flawed Indie Masterpiece
This is one of the best indies I've ever experienced, it has an insane plot twist at the end, which I won't spoil, and also cliffhanger for a DLC can be later enjoyed. I can't say much about it's DLC though, since I was burnt out after I saw the credits rolling, because even though this is an amazing title, it is a very very long one. So be prepared to get overwhelmed sometimes if you played this like me, from start to finish, this shows it has some serious pacing issues. Despite this, I'm excited to play the other games this developer is creating, and if you are a fan of action RPGs to any extent, this is definitely a must-play in my opinion.
