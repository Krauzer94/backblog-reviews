## Gothic Metroidvania Revival
This game is a visually striking side-scrolling action game that blends elements of the classic Metroidvania formula with the modern Lords of Shadow combat style. Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 and later remastered in HD for PC, it retains its gothic art direction and atmospheric presentation, with detailed environments and a haunting soundtrack that bring its dark fantasy world to life. A lot of fans are not very fond to the Lords of Shadows franchise, not me though, I love it and it is the only game I've 100% back in PlayStation 3 era.

## Whip-Based Combat Focus
The gameplay focuses on a mix of whip-based combat, platforming, and light exploration, so the classic whip is back in place of the more RPG weapon varieties. You take control of multiple protagonists across different time periods, each with their own abilities, offering variety but sometimes breaking the pacing. Combat is satisfying and weighty, with combos, magic, and sub-weapons adding depth, though the frequent use of quick-time events can feel intrusive.

## Linear Design Limitations
While it borrows structural cues from Metroidvania design, exploration is relatively linear and often lacks meaningful rewards, making backtracking feel less engaging, and it is understandable since this game was originally released for a handheld. The narrative, while steeped in Belmont family drama, can be predictable and is occasionally interrupted by character switches that disrupt momentum, this may hurts pacing a bit. Overall, this game delivers a short but focused campaign with strong visuals and combat, yet it falls short of the depth and polish of the series’ best titles.
