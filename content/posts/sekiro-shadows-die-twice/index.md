## Precision Over Power
This videogame is an action-adventure game from FromSoftware that pushes players into a brutal, skill-based combat system unlike the studio’s earlier Souls games. Set in a reimagined late 1500s Japan, it blends swordplay, stealth, and vertical movement to create a fluid and tense gameplay experience. It may not sound like a very original game at first, but each and every mechanic is so masterfully implemented that it sets itself apart, and by a big difference, from any previous implementation with similar ideas.

## Posture-Driven Combat
The game’s defining feature is its posture system, which forces precise parrying and timing rather than relying on stamina management. Though don't mistake this for how stamina works on Soulslike games at all, they are completely different mechanics. This makes every duel feel like a high-stakes test of reflexes. Stealth and traversal add flexibility, but combat mastery is essential, especially against its many punishing bosses. I love stealth in videogames, and this one was no different, even though it is has very simple mechanics on this regard.

## Brutal Beauty
Visually, the game is stunning, with rich environments ranging from serene temples to grotesque battlefields, all tied together by atmospheric sound design. The resurrection mechanic also introduces unique strategic choices, letting players push risks further. While its difficulty can be overwhelming and weapon variety is limited compared to other FromSoftware titles, Sekiro delivers one of the most rewarding single-player experiences of its generation. I consider this one of the best games of all time, but that is because I'm a die-hard Soulslike fan, to the point that I wished I could forget everything about this game, so I can play it again for the first time, there is no excuse to skip this one.

## A Singular Experience
And I wished we had more games similar to this one, less focused on the complex RPG mechanics and builds, and implement more platforming and stealth mechanics instead, creating more unique experiences. Though I understand that this has very little replay value, despite it having a lot of hidden secrets and extra content besides the main quest, it is still a very simple experience compared to traditional Soulslike RPG titles.
