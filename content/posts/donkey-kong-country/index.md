## A SNES Landmark
This is a groundbreaking platformer developed by Rare that pushed the Super Nintendo’s graphics to new heights with its revolutionary pre-rendered 3D visuals. The gameplay is tight and responsive, featuring dynamic duo Donkey and Diddy Kong as they traverse diverse, beautifully animated environments to reclaim their stolen banana hoard. The level design is varied and clever, the soundtrack is iconic, and the game strikes a great balance between challenge and accessibility, it's a classic that redefined what the SNES could do and still holds up remarkably well today.

## Challenging Timeless Classic
I consider this my 2nd favorite DK of the SNES platform, just because it is simply too challenging, not just for my old me at the time, but even replaying it in modern hardware. But this is a good thing since it developed my skills to play and enjoy other easier platformers that came into my way. This is yet another must play for the SNES platform, and will forever be a platforming classic among other titles at the time.
