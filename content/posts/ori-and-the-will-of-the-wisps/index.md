## A Stunning Evolution
The second Ori entry is a visually stunning action-platformer, as a sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest. It expands the original with a larger world, improved combat mechanics, and a more intricate narrative. The hand-painted visuals and fluid animations, combined with the evocative soundtrack, create an immersive and emotionally resonant experience. The first title was already a very high level game through literally all of it's aspects, mechanics, visuals and OST, and it is incredible that this sequel was able to expand this even further.

## Combat Takes Center Stage
The gameplay introduces a more robust combat system, featuring weapons like the Spirit Edge sword and the Smash hammer, as well as skill stones that allow customization of Ori’s abilities. Combat is it's biggest standout in my opinion, when compared to the first title, which was more about exploration and platforming, but this new one has much more depth, adding enough complexity to feel more like an action platformer. Platforming challenges and chase sequences demand precision and quick reflexes, providing both excitement and difficulty for most people.

## Emotional, Masterful Journey
The story follows Ori and their owl companion Ku, navigating a beautifully crafted world filled with danger and wonder. The game’s narrative effectively conveys emotion without relying heavily on dialogue, making the journey deeply moving. The game’s artistic and gameplay achievements make it a standout in the platforming genre. Overall, Ori and the Will of the Wisps combines breathtaking visuals, refined gameplay, and heartfelt storytelling into a memorable experience that is highly recommended for fans of action-platformers. This is a must-play in my opinion, definitely one of the best videogames that I've played, not just when it comes to it's genre, sub-genre and what it is trying to achieve, but also on each and every aspect it is trying to convey.
