## Flexible Stealth Gameplay
This Splinter Cell entry is a polished and versatile stealth-action game that refines the series’ formula with a focus on player choice. It allows you to complete missions using different playstyles, sneaking through shadows as a ghost, silently eliminating enemies as a panther, or going loud with direct combat. Though it doesn't really make any sense to play this if you are not going full stealth/assassin since this is the main idea of this game, though the "action" route is always available.

## Freedom and Atmosphere
This flexibility, paired with strong level design featuring multiple paths and tools, gives each mission a sense of freedom and replayability that few stealth games achieve. Unfortunately for me, I played this game very late, so I have no experience with it's online features in order to be able to give any meaningful opinion on this. Its atmosphere captures the essence of espionage with clever use of lighting and sound, and the wide range of gadgets reinforces the tactical gameplay Splinter Cell is known for.

## Story and Presentation Issues
However, the story feels fairly conventional, and the change in Sam Fisher’s voice and tone may not satisfy long-time fans, and I particularly don't mind this but I can see this being something that the community would bring up at the time of it's release. While the visuals are serviceable, some textures and animations show their age, and the game occasionally leans too heavily toward action, diluting the stealth tension of earlier titles like Chaos Theory.

## Strong Modern Entry
Despite these flaws, this game stands as one of the most complete entries in the series. It balances modern accessibility with classic stealth depth, delivering an engaging and replayable experience for both newcomers and veterans of the franchise. I would only suggest this as a must-play for fans of the franchise, otherwise, it is just a very good stealth game in general, just not as legendary as it's predecessors.
