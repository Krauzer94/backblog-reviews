## Epic Mythic Combat
The first Darksiders entry is a bold, action-adventure game that combines fast-paced hack-and-slash combat with exploration and puzzle-solving. The MC is called War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who is wrongly blamed for bringing about the end of the world prematurely. The narrative is dark and mythic, filled with twists and an overarching sense of epic scale, giving the player a strong sense of purpose as they traverse a post-apocalyptic Earth. Combat is one of the game’s strongest points, offering satisfying melee combos, ranged attacks, and supernatural powers that feel weighty and impactful.

## Action Meets Exploration
It keeps itself close to the level of quality and complexity of games such as Devil May Cry. The game also features platforming elements and environmental puzzles reminiscent of classic adventure games, adding variety to the core combat loops. Some say it even reaches the same levels of quality of games such as The Legend of Zelda when it comes to the puzzles, exploration and dungeons. Exploration is rewarding, with hidden upgrades, collectibles, and lore scattered throughout the world, encouraging you to fully engage with its environments.

## Stylish, Lasting Impact
While some textures, animations, and camera angles show their age, Darksiders’ distinctive comic-inspired art style remains striking and gives the game a unique visual identity. One of it's standouts to me are the cutscenes, which has the artstyle of comic books, quite a unique story-telling trait. Overall, Darksiders is a memorable and ambitious debut that still holds up as a solid action-adventure game with plenty of personality, it is one of the best action-adventure games that I've ever played, and this says a lot since this is one of the most saturated genres of all time.
