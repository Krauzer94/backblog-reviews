## Promising Idea, Poor Execution
I didn’t enjoy Krater at all, the game starts with an interesting premise, an action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic Sweden, but that’s where the fun stops. I played only a few hours, and it didn’t take long for the flaws to become obvious. The combat felt really repetitive, with a limited variety of skills and enemies. I found myself doing the same thing over and over, with little progression or challenge to keep me engaged.

## Shallow Systems, Frustrating Design
The character progression system didn’t seem to add much either, while the implant-based upgrades were a cool idea on paper, they didn’t feel impactful enough to keep me invested. The game’s pacing was also off. It was too easy early on, and then suddenly became grindy with no real middle ground. The UI and controls were clunky, and it wasn’t intuitive to navigate, which made the whole experience feel frustrating.
