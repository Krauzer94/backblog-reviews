## Cooperative Action Adventure
This title is a top-down action-adventure game that shines in its cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can team up to solve puzzles, fight mythological enemies, and explore beautifully rendered Egyptian tombs. The blend of action, platforming, and environmental puzzles makes for an engaging experience, especially when coordination between players is needed. The visuals are appealing, with strong lighting effects and detailed environments that bring the ancient setting to life.

## Flawed Solo Experience
However, the game isn’t without flaws, the isometric perspective sometimes makes platforming feel imprecise, and the story, while serviceable, lacks emotional depth or originality compared to the mainline entries in the series. Solo players may find the game short and less satisfying, as the design clearly favors cooperative play. Unfortunately for me this is how I played this title, without using the coop feature, and it is not the ideal way of playing, I advise againts it if you don't have company for this title.

## Fun With Friends
Overall, this game offers a fun and polished co-op adventure that’s best enjoyed with friends. It may not be groundbreaking or as ambitious as mainline Tomb Raider titles, but its charm lies in its fast-paced teamwork, light puzzle-solving, and mythological atmosphere. This is most definitely not a must-play, but a nice title if you want to experience more Tomb Raider and have already played the other Lara Croft games.
