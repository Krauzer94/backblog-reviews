## Stylish Combat Evolution
This is a stylish and fast-paced action game that combines flashy combat with gothic atmosphere and a melodramatic storyline, so no news here, it sticks to what the previous titles did correctly. The MC now is Nero, a new protagonist with a demonic arm that adds fresh mechanics to the series' classic sword-and-gunplay, which was a standout at the time. The combat is fluid and satisfying, encouraging combo experimentation and precision, visually, it was impressive for its time, especially on PC, offering high-resolution textures and smooth performance.

## Repetitive Yet Rewarding
However, the level design suffers from repetition, especially in the second half where players revisit earlier stages, this happens more with Nero than with Dante (spoiler, you play as both) especially with the angels fights, since they lack variety compared to the demons. The story, while engaging for fans, can feel thin or over-the-top to newcomers. Still, DMC4 stands as a solid entry in the franchise, offering deep combat mechanics and a rewarding challenge for action game fans, definitely a must-play for those who like Hack'N Slash to any extent, one of my favorites.

## Accessible Yet Deep Combat
One of its strongest points is how well it balances accessibility with depth, newcomers can enjoy the spectacle and feel powerful without mastering every system, while veterans will find plenty of room to push the combat to its limits, especially when experimenting with Nero’s Devil Bringer or Dante’s multiple fighting styles. The ranking system remains a core motivator, constantly encouraging players to fight creatively rather than safely, and the OST dynamically amplifies the adrenaline during high-style moments.

## Aging Well on PC
On the PC side, the port was surprisingly competent for its era, with customizable settings and stable performance that allowed the game’s smooth combat to truly shine. Keyboard and mouse support was serviceable, though a controller was clearly the intended way to play. Even years later, the 4th DMC entry holds up remarkably well thanks to its responsive gameplay and strong art direction, making it not just a product of its time, but a game that still feels enjoyable and relevant for action fans today.
