## Stylish Combat Evolution
This is a stylish and fast-paced action game that combines flashy combat with gothic atmosphere and a melodramatic storyline, so no news here, it sticks to what the previous titles did correctly. The MC now is Nero, a new protagonist with a demonic arm that adds fresh mechanics to the series' classic sword-and-gunplay, which was a standout at the time. The combat is fluid and satisfying, encouraging combo experimentation and precision, visually, it was impressive for its time, especially on PC, offering high-resolution textures and smooth performance.

## Repetitive Yet Rewarding
However, the level design suffers from repetition, especially in the second half where players revisit earlier stages, this happens more with Nero than with Dante (spoiler, you play as both) especially with the angels fights, since they lack variety compared to the demons. The story, while engaging for fans, can feel thin or over-the-top to newcomers. Still, DMC4 stands as a solid entry in the franchise, offering deep combat mechanics and a rewarding challenge for action game fans, definitely a must-play for those who like Hack'N Slash to any extent, one of my favorites.
