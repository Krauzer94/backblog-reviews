## FPS/RPG Hybrid Roots
This title is a modern re-release of the 1996 hybrid FPS/RPG, and unlike most shooters of its time, it combines first-person action with light RPG mechanics, allowing you to interact with NPCs, engage in dialogue, and complete quest-like objectives. The game gives you a sense of choice in how they approach situations, whether through combat, negotiation, or exploration. The world of Strife is set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic industrial environment dominated by a sinister cult known as “The Order.” This narrative depth, combined with the your ability to affect outcomes through dialogue and quests, gives the game a more story-driven approach compared to many of its contemporaries, making it stand out in the mid-1990s shooter landscape.

## Revolutionary Remastered Return
And while it may not sound unique for today's standards, this is fore sure one of the most revolutionary games of it's time, there is nothing quite like this on this period of time in gaming. The Veteran Edition, released by Nightdive Studios (these folks are amazing), modernizes the original game to run on contemporary systems. It adds widescreen support, improved input options, and enhanced compatibility with modern operating systems, making it far easier to experience on current PCs, or PC Handhelds. The weapons, ranging from conventional firearms to more unique tools like the flamethrower or the mauler, offer you a variety of ways to approach combat encounters.

## Challenging Retro Exploration
I played it in the normal difficulty level and I still had a lot of challenge, especially because all the maps have a very high number of enemies, and they can quickly swarm you. The game’s design encourages exploration, and you are often rewarded for taking the time to search environments and talk to NPCs. For fans of retro gaming, these features help preserve the charm and identity of the original while making it accessible to modern audiences. Despite these improvements, Strife’s underlying engine, derived from the Doom engine lineage, shows its age. Level design can be confusing, with maze-like layouts that are sometimes difficult to navigate.

## Aged Yet Charming Design
Enemy behavior is limited, and while the game offers multiple playstyles, many sections push you toward a more linear, combat-heavy approach. Some mechanics, such as stealth or negotiation, feel underdeveloped, and the interface can be clunky by modern standards. Visually, the game looks dated, and while the Veteran Edition smooths over technical issues, it cannot fully modernize the aesthetics of a mid-1990s game. Though for me personally I really like this aesthetic, so I cannot count this aspect of the game as a complete downside, there are quite good-looking titles nowadays which uses this art-style such as Ion Fury, for example.

## Enduring Retro Appeal
Overall, this game is a compelling experience for people interested in retro shooters or the history of FPS/RPG hybrids. It is not a polished, modern game, but it succeeds in preserving the spirit and atmosphere of the original. Its combination of narrative depth, exploration, and combat provides a nostalgic yet engaging experience, particularly for those willing to approach it with patience and a retro gaming mindset. For fans of classic games or those curious about the evolution of story-driven shooters, this one definitely remains a noteworthy and enjoyable title.
