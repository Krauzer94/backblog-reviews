## Horror Meets Gunplay
F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), released in 2005 for PC, is a standout fusion of tactical (though not by much) first-person shooting and psychological horror. It combines intense, slow-motion gunfights with creepy, supernatural storytelling, driven by a mysterious little girl named Alma who haunts your every step.

## Ahead of Its Time
The AI was advanced for its time, and in my opinion it surpassed ones such as Half-Life 2, which was an impressive feat at the time, making enemies feel smart and reactive. While the environments can get repetitive and the plot grows cryptic, the eerie atmosphere and thrilling combat make it a memorable and genre-defining experience.

## Multiplayer Done Right
The multiplayer was one of the most fun shooters that I've ever played, I really miss these kinds of multiplayer games nowadays, which are more focused on making a fun experience, rather than trying to make you addicted to grinding the ranks. I highly recommend not skipping this one if you are a fan of shooter games to any extend, it is truly one of the best the genre can provide, and I argue it is very good even if you don't like horror games, the shooting is amazingly satisfying.
