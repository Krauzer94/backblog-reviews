## A Portable Classic
This title is a direct port of the 1985 original that helped define the platforming genre, introduced in the NES platform. The game retains all the iconic elements that made it a classic, tight controls, clever level design, and a simple yet satisfying gameplay loop that’s easy to pick up but challenging to master, no no surprises here. Playing through the familiar worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom on the go was a nostalgic treat for longtime fans and a history lesson for newer players.

## Timeless Secrets & Charm
The visuals and audio are unchanged from the NES version, preserving the retro charm but also highlighting the limitations of the era. One of my favorite elements on all Mario games is the amount of secrets it has, which helps with the replayability, and this one is no exception. Nintendo tried to implement these elements right from the get go, in their first entry, and even for today's standards, it feels like a nice little adventure to find them, as much as the first time playing.
