## Sniping System Highlights
This title is a third-person tactical shooter set in the final days of World War II, where you take the role of an American sniper operating in war-torn Berlin. The game’s highlight is its sniping system, bullet drop, wind resistance, and breath control all factor into each shot, creating a rewarding and tense experience. The X-Ray Kill Cam, showing bullets tearing through enemy bodies in slow motion, adds a unique cinematic flair that became the series’ signature.

## Aging Design Issues
However, the game shows its age in several areas, levels are mostly linear, limiting your freedom, and the AI can feel inconsistent, sometimes spotting you unrealistically or failing to react at all. Stealth sections outside of sniping scenarios tend to be clunky, and the visuals, while atmospheric, are dated compared to other 2012 releases. Though I still recommend going stealth on this title since this is really how this game was planned to be played in the first place, not to mention it is more fun using this approach.

## Still Worth Playing
Despite its flaws, this game remains enjoyable for those who appreciate patience and precision over fast-paced action. It’s a solid niche experience, not a technical masterpiece, but a satisfying sniping simulator that rewards methodical play. This was the first title of many when it comes to this franchise, despite it having released titles previous to this one. I recommend playing this if you are a fan, otherwise, the more recent entries have a higher quality than this one.
