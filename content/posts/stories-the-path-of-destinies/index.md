## Stylish Narrative Hook
This title is a charming action RPG with a unique branching narrative, the MC is called Reynardo, a witty fox who relives different paths in search of the true ending, with each run revealing new “Truths” and possibilities. The storybook presentation, colorful cel-shaded visuals, and a charismatic narrator give the game a distinct personality that stands out from other indie titles of its time. This one is yet another title that I got interested in playing it solely because of the art-style, but I finished playing it because of the gameplay.

## Fun but Repetitive Combat
Combat is fast-paced and enjoyable, with upgradeable swords and magical abilities that keep fights engaging, at least at first. However, the enemy variety and environments are limited, which makes extended playthroughs feel repetitive. It is indeed not a very complex and replayable game, but this was never the intention, its a short and concise experience. This repetition is the game’s biggest drawback, as pursuing multiple endings often means revisiting similar levels with only slight variations.

## A Worthwhile Hidden Gem
Despite this, the clever writing, humor, and inventive narrative structure make the experience worthwhile. The PC version runs smoothly and remains the best way to enjoy the game. If you like story-driven adventures with meaningful choices and don’t mind some repetition, this game is a hidden gem worth exploring. If you are looking for a more complex game, with lots of characters, and gameplay variety, then stir away from this one.
