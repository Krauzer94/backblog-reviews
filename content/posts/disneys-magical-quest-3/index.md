## Costume-Based Co-op Adventure
Originally released only in Japan and later in the West via Game Boy Advance, it features Mickey and Donald on a magical rescue mission, offering both solo and co-op gameplay. The standout feature is the variety of costumes, similar to other Capcom's Disney titles at the time, each granting unique abilities like climbing or flying, which adds fun variety and strategy. While the graphics and music are charming and polished, typical of Capcom's SNES work, the game is easier and shorter than other platformers of its time, still, it’s a delightful adventure, especially for fans of Disney or co-op platformers.

## Replayable Costume Fun
I love the costume mechanics, this was the most exciting thing for me at the time, since their variety made the gameplay very fun, not to mention the level of replayability it added, whether if you decide o play it solo, or if you have a friend to join you, so there are plenty of options to mix and match the gameplay styles of both characters.
