## A Strong Reboot
This Tomb Raider entry is a strong reboot of the series by Crystal Dynamics, bringing Lara back to her roots with a focus on action, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The PC version delivers smooth platforming and cinematic presentation, giving the game a polished feel compared to its predecessor, The Angel of Darkness (which I really don't recommend).

## Streamlined Exploration Focus
The gameplay emphasizes linear progression, with fluid movement and a new grappling hook that adds verticality and dynamic traversal. While some players may miss the more open-ended exploration of earlier titles, the streamlined design keeps the experience engaging and well-paced. While it feels like a Tomb Raider title, it does not have the same level of depth of the PlayStation 1 title, it really feels much more linear and action-focused.

## Polished Combat Presentation
Combat is accessible and fast-paced, featuring improved controls and animations. Some vehicle sections, however, were criticized for awkward handling, which slightly disrupts the otherwise smooth gameplay. Visually, the game impressed for its time, with detailed environments, realistic character models, and cinematic cutscenes that enhance immersion.

## Enjoyable Yet Skippable
A lot of people generally praised Legend for revitalizing the franchise. It earned positive reviews for returning to the series’ adventurous roots, balancing platforming, puzzles, and combat effectively. Particularly I really enjoyed playing this one though I consider it a skippable title for this series. While it may lack the open-ended freedom of older Tomb Raider games, it delivers a refined and enjoyable experience for both new and longtime fans.
