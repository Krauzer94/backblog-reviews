## Classic CRPG Revival
The first entry to Pillars of Eternity, developed by Obsidian Entertainment, is a crowdfunded isometric RPG that pays loving homage to the classic CRPGs of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Baldur’s Gate and Planescape: Torment. At the heart of the game is the role of the “Watcher,” a rare individual who can see and interact with souls. This unique ability forms the backbone of a story that is rich, morally complex, and deeply personal, as players uncover the mysteries behind a spiritual catastrophe known as the Hollowborn plague. It really gets close on the feeling of playing a computer version of a table-top RPG campaign.

## Morally Complex Narrative
The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is one of the most compelling aspects of the game. You traverse the continent of Eora, exploring diverse regions from bustling cities to dangerous wilderness, encountering political conflicts, ancient secrets, and moral dilemmas. One standout quest involves unraveling the mystery of the Hollowborn: investigating the disappearance of unborn children and uncovering the dark forces at work behind this tragedy. This quest is both emotionally impactful and intellectually engaging, reflecting the game’s strength in blending story and gameplay.

## Memorable Companions
Companions are another highlight of the game, each with distinct personalities, backstories, and quests. For example, Eder is a charming, battle-hardened warrior with a dry sense of humor and personal struggles that slowly unfold as he journeys with the player. Aloth, a sarcastic wizard, has a tragic past that leads to some of the game’s most emotional moments. Durance, a conflicted priest, challenges players’ moral assumptions and provides opportunities for philosophical discussions about faith and power. Though I confess that I tried to stick to the simplest party layout I could find, since I really just wanted to experience the story, rather than min-max the RPG mechanics, which were complex enough for me to almost no keep up with it.

## Tactical RPG Systems
Companion quests often intersect with the main story, creating a layered narrative that rewards careful attention and thoughtful choices. Gameplay is tactical and challenging, combining real-time combat with a pause system that allows precise planning. Battles are strategic, requiring you to balance positioning, abilities, and resources. Character creation is highly detailed: you can customize your race, class, abilities, and even background, which influences both dialogue options and interactions with companions and factions.

## Dangerous, Rewarding Exploration
Exploration is rewarding, with hidden treasures, optional dungeons, and lore-rich encounters that make the world feel alive and reactive. But keep on the lookout for traps, some of them can literally take down your entire party, if not careful. You can try to workaround this using trap detection spells and abilities, which I highly recommend having at all times.

## Narrative RPG Masterclass
Ultimately, Pillars of Eternity stands out as a masterclass in narrative-driven RPG design. Its combination of memorable companions, meaningful quests, and a meticulously crafted world ensures that players are not just playing a game but participating in a living, breathing story. For fans of classic RPGs and anyone seeking a rich, immersive, and emotionally resonant experience, this title is definitely is a must-play.
