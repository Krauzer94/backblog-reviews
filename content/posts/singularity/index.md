## Time Manipulation Core
This game is a sci-fi FPS with survival-horror undertones that blends action, atmosphere, and time-bending mechanics. The story shifts between 1955 and 2010 on a mysterious Soviet island, you use a tool called Time Manipulation Device (TMD) to age enemies into dust, restore decayed objects, freeze time, and unleash destructive energy bursts. This serves as a soft-puzzle mechanic as much as a narrative instrument, and as a secondary use, also in combat.

## Cold War Unfolding
The plot leans heavily on Cold War paranoia and pulpy science-fiction tropes, gradually unfolding through exploration, audio logs, and environmental storytelling, which where traits very common for story-telling in shooters and action games in general, at the era in which this game was released. Combat is varied and satisfying, with the TMD ensuring encounters rarely feel repetitive. The game offers a tight, linear campaign that rarely overstays its welcome. While it features serviceable shooting mechanics, the time powers are the real draw, elevating otherwise familiar FPS gunplay into something more creative and memorable.

## Underrated Narrative Shooter
Visually, Singularity delivers a moody, retro-futuristic style, though the PC version suffers from dated textures, limited graphic settings, and a lack of modern audio support. Though short and with limited replayability, Singularity has earned cult status among players who appreciate its blend of inventive mechanics and engaging narrative. It remains a compact but memorable experience that stands out as one of the more underrated shooters of its generation. I consider this one of the best shooters focused on narrative, such as Half-Life for example, since we don't really get to see many of those compared to other shooters such as competitive and/or multiplayer ones.
