## Cinematic Stealth Sandbox
This game is a polished and cinematic prologue to MGS The Phantom Pain, showcasing a refined stealth system, fluid controls, and a detailed open-ended mission area in Camp Omega. The game allows for multiple approaches, encouraging replay through its sandbox design and side missions. The PC version enhances the experience with impressive graphical fidelity, including sharper textures, better lighting, and smoother performance for those with capable hardware.

## Brief Yet Pricey Prologue
However, the main story mission can be completed in under half an hour, and even with side content, total playtime rarely exceeds a few hours. This brevity, combined with its initial pricing, led many to view it as an extended demo rather than a full game. While its mechanics and presentation are excellent, the limited content left some people feeling that Ground Zeroes served more as a paid teaser for the larger experience to come than a complete standalone title.
