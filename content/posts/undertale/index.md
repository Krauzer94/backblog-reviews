## Retro Roots, Modern Soul
Undertale is a one-of-a-kind indie RPG that blends retro aesthetics with modern storytelling in a way few games have matched. Created almost entirely by Toby Fox, it draws inspiration from classic titles like EarthBound (fun-fact: the song "Megalomania" comes from this game, it was not originally composed by Fox), yet quickly establishes its own distinct personality. The pixel art style and catchy chiptune soundtrack may appear simple at first glance, but both are meticulously crafted to match the game’s shifting tone, the OST is by far one of the best aspects in my opinion, it is one of the best soundtracks in gaming history.

## Morality Through Choice
What sets Undertale apart is its unconventional approach to combat and morality. Instead of the usual “fight or run” dynamic, you can choose to resolve encounters peacefully, talking and negotiating with enemies until they no longer wish to fight. This choice between mercy and violence isn’t just a gimmick, it fundamentally changes the story, the characters’ reactions, and even the tone of the entire game. Every decision feels personal and consequential, making multiple playthroughs not only worthwhile, but essential to truly grasp the game’s depth. I highly encourage this game is played at least twice, so it is possible to experience both the pacifist and the genocide routes.

## Unforgettable Character Cast
The cast is full of memorable personalities, from the goofy skeleton brothers Sans and Papyrus to the awkward yet endearing scientist Alphys, each brought to life through sharp writing and expressive spritework. The characters alone can easily carry this game, not to mention it's fanbase which is still dedicated yet to this day, part of this has to do with the amazing cast. The humor is sharp and self-aware, but it’s balanced by moments of genuine emotion that can be unexpectedly moving.

## Expectation-Breaking Design
The game constantly subverts expectations, whether by poking fun at RPG tropes or breaking the fourth wall in ways that make you feel like the game itself is aware of you. At the time, this was a very unique trait since very few games did this, though nowadays it has become more common since this title had, and still has, a big influence in the gaming industry. I'll never forget how I was blown away by the first time I played this title, it is one of those games that you wish you could have your memory erased so that you could play it for the first time again.

## Short Yet Timeless
At around 6~8 hours for a first run, it is relatively short, but it leaves a lasting impression that far outlives its playtime. It’s a rare example of a game that’s as playful as it is profound, capable of making you laugh, think, and even question your own choices. Whether you take the pacifist route, embrace chaos, or walk a morally gray path, Undertale ensures that your story, and the feelings it inspires, will be uniquely your own. I consider this one of the best games in history, alongside something like Final Fantasy VI, VII and others, don't skip this, and also, don't skip the other Toby Fox games, Deltarune is basically part of Undertale and a must play for the fans.
