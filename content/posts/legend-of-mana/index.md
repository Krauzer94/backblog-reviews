## Dreamlike Freedom and Choice
This title is a visually stunning and deeply imaginative action RPG from Square, it stands out for its non-linear storytelling, where players build the world map using an artifact system called the “Land Make” feature. The lush, hand-painted 2D graphics and enchanting soundtrack give the game a dreamlike charm. However, the fragmented narrative and lack of a central plot can feel disjointed. Combat is simple but fun, and there’s a lot of customization. It’s a unique, artistic experience best enjoyed by those who value exploration and atmosphere over traditional structure, this is the best aspect of the game for me since there are lots of different weapons to choose from, and combos to learn.

## Systems Over Story
Though you can quickly become overpowered so the game starts to feel easy, but at least the non-linear story present a lot of side-quests, which are very interesting, since, as already mentioned, there isn't really an "ultimate main plot", compared to other more traditional RPGs. Another mechanic that I really enjoy is the pet system, in which you can level up your pet in order to help with the combat, not to mention the secret elements you can try to tame using musical instruments, and at the end of the day, there are no badly implemented mechanics on this game, though at the same time, none of them are outstanding in any way.

## Storybook Atmosphere
What truly elevates this game beyond its systems is its atmosphere and presentation, the watercolor-like backgrounds, expressive character sprites, and whimsical creature designs give every location a storybook quality that few RPGs have ever matched. The OST is memorable, with gentle melodies and emotional themes that will for sure be on your JRPG playlist. The sidequests received a lot of love compared to other similar titles, especially because JRPGs usually handle these as fillers for grinding, instead of trully meaningful contents. Whether you’re helping a lonely NPC or uncovering a bittersweet tale hidden within a newly placed land.

## Quiet, Personal Journey
Overall, this title is less about epic stakes and more about personal journeys and quiet moments. Its experimental structure may not satisfy people looking for a tight narrative or challenging combat, but it excels at creating a relaxing experience. It invites you to explore at your own pace, experiment with its crafting systems, and immerse yourself in its charming world. While it may not reach the dramatic highs of other RPGs from its era, its creativity and artistic identity make it a memorable and distinctive entry in the genre.
