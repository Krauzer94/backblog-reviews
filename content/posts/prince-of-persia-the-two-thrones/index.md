## Balanced Final Chapter
This title brings the Sands of Time trilogy to a strong and satisfying close. After the darker and more violent tone of Warrior Within, this entry strikes a better balance between the emotional storytelling of the first game and the intense action of the second. The Prince returns to Babylon, only to find his kingdom in ruins and his past actions coming back to haunt him. What follows is a tightly woven tale of redemption, inner conflict, and fate. As for the gameplay, it refines the series’ signature mix of fluid platforming, acrobatics, and time manipulation.

## Refined Parkour Combat
The parkour sequences remain the highlight, leaping across walls, swinging from poles, and dodging deadly traps feels as smooth and rewarding as ever. Combat has been improved with the addition of the “Speed Kill” system, allowing for stealthy and cinematic takedowns. The introduction of the “Dark Prince,” a twisted version of the protagonist who uses a chain weapon and gradually loses health over time, adds an exciting layer of risk and variety to the experience. In my opinion this mechanic was not explored enough since the scale of this game was insanely small compared to Warrior Within, which in comparison, can even start to make it feel like the previous entry was almost an open-world metriodvania, even if it is not one.

## Emotional Trilogy Finale
Visually, the PlayStation 2 version shows the hardware’s limits, but the game’s art direction, moody lighting, and atmospheric OST help maintain a sense of grandeur. The story’s pacing, combined with a heartfelt ending, gives the trilogy a strong emotional closure. While occasional camera issues and some dated textures remain, it succeeds in blending action, puzzle-solving, and storytelling into a cohesive and memorable adventure, a fitting farewell to one of the most iconic heroes of the PS2 era. This was one of the first PlayStation 2 games that I've ever played, and I finished it without using a memory card simply because I was blown away by it, one of the best of it's platform.
