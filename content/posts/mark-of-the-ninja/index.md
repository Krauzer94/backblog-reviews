## Elegant Stealth Design
This game is a standout 2D stealth game that blends fluid controls, clever level design, and a striking visual style. It distinguishes itself with a unique system that visualizes sound and light, making stealth mechanics clear and intuitive without breaking immersion. The levels offer multiple approaches, whether you prefer ghost-like infiltration or creative use of traps and distractions, and the responsive controls make movement and combat feel precise and satisfying.

## Stylish Ninja Mastery
Its hand-drawn art style, dynamic lighting, and smooth animation create an atmospheric world that feels both tense and stylish. While the story of a tattooed ninja avenging his clan is serviceable and presented through comic-style cutscenes, it mainly serves as a backdrop for the gameplay. Replayability is high thanks to optional objectives, hidden collectibles, and a challenging New Game Plus mode. Overall, it’s a masterclass in stealth design that makes you truly feel like a ninja, one of the best, and most unique, stealth platformer titles I've ever played.
