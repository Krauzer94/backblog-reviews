## Sci-Fi Soulslike Setting
The first The Surge entry is a sci-fi action RPG developed by Deck13 that follows in the footsteps of the Souls series while carving out its own identity. Set in a dystopian future dominated by exoskeleton rigs and malfunctioning machines, the game puts you in the role of Warren, a man thrust into chaos at the CREO facility. This technological setting is perfect for the Soulslike formula, and I'm surprised we don't have more titles similar to this one.

## Tactical Limb Combat
The biggest strength of the game lies in its combat system. Instead of simply hacking at enemies, you can target specific limbs to dismember them and gain crafting materials or gear, adding a tactical layer that feels fresh. This makes up for the lack of elements such as magic, since it's setting wouldn't allow for this to make any sense, and it add some much needed dept to the viable playstyles. Weapons, implants, and upgrades allow for solid build customization, and boss fights deliver intense, punishing encounters that reward patience and mastery.

## Atmosphere With Limitations
The industrial sci-fi setting creates a tense atmosphere, but the environments often look too similar, which makes exploration repetitive and navigation confusing. The narrative starts with promise but fails to maintain momentum, offering little in terms of memorable characters or storytelling. Technical issues like awkward camera angles and inconsistent hit detection can also break immersion, not to mention the weird movement and feeling of impact, compared to other titles of the similar genre.

## Strong Yet Imperfect
Overall, this game is a challenging and rewarding experience for players who enjoy methodical, punishing combat in the style of Dark Souls. Its unique limb-targeting system and gritty atmosphere make it stand out, though its repetitive environments and weaker narrative prevent it from reaching the same heights as its inspirations. Despite it's drawbacks I highly recommend this for fans of the Soulslike genre, it is definitely one of the best out there.
