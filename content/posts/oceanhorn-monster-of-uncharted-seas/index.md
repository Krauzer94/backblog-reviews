## Zelda-Inspired Adventure
This game is a colorful action-adventure game clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda, particularly Wind Waker and A Link to the Past. It offers exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat, wrapped in a vibrant, cel-shaded art style. I'm particularly a fan of the Zelda games, but I'm not really a Nintendo fan, so I'm biased when it comes to these Zelda-like titles because they are the only way for me to experience Zelda again.

## Charming Presentation Strengths
The soundtrack, featuring contributions from renowned composers like Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito, enhances the atmosphere and gives the game a warm, nostalgic tone. And this element is very important since it really helps setting the atmosphere of the game, similar to how the games that inspired it. The game’s strengths lie in its charming presentation, approachable gameplay, and steady sense of progression through new equipment, upgrades, and XP-based perks.

## Familiar Yet Shallow
However, its heavy reliance on familiar mechanics means it lacks a strong original identity, combat and puzzles are simple, offering little challenge for veterans, and sailing between islands is mostly automated, making travel feel repetitive. The narrative and dungeon design, while serviceable, don’t always feel as polished or engaging as its inspirations. And there are no RPG elements like many Zelda-like titles tend to have, which brings a little more complexity to the table, so don't expect too much on this regard.

## Relaxed Nostalgic Journey
Overall, Oceanhorn is an enjoyable, beginner-friendly adventure with beautiful visuals and a relaxing soundtrack. Don't let yourself be fooled by this game's origin being in the mobile platforms, this is pretty much a full-fledged single-player adventure game. It’s best suited for players in the mood for an accessible, nostalgia-driven journey, but those looking for deeper gameplay or a fresh twist on the formula may find it a bit lightweight.
