## Political Fantasy Epic
This Final Fantasy entry is one of the most ambitious tactical RPGs of its time, blending a richly layered political narrative with deep, rewarding gameplay. Set in the kingdom of Ivalice, the story follows Ramza Beoulve, a young noble caught between loyalty to his family, the corruption of the aristocracy, and the struggles of commoners in a land torn apart by war. Unlike many other Final Fantasy entries, this game focuses less on grand fantasy tropes and more on themes of betrayal, class conflict, and moral ambiguity, making its story unusually mature and grounded for the era.

## Deep Tactical Freedom
This game's story has way more depth compared to other entries in the series, despite it having a cute art-style, not to mention the amount of characters and complex plots you need to keep up with. That being said, if regular FF is already complex enough for you, then I wouldn't recommend this one, because it escalates this trait by a lot. Gameplay unfolds on grid-based battlefields where careful positioning, job selection, and long-term planning are crucial. The job system is a highlight, offering tremendous freedom to shape your army by mixing and matching skills across dozens of classes, from traditional knights and mages to unique options like calculators and ninjas.

## Punishing Strategic Mastery
This depth ensures that no two playthroughs are exactly alike. Battles can be punishing, but the challenge makes every victory satisfying. If you like party RPGs in general, than this is one of the best games you can experience, because you'll practically be managing multiple different characters, and this is not limited to their equipment, but their progression in general. Complementing the strategic gameplay is a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, which enhances the game’s serious tone, and an amazing OST is already a trait in the series. Although the original English translation was awkward at times, the core story and atmosphere still shine through.

## Timeless Tactical Classic
With its complex systems, mature themes, and innovative approach to RPG storytelling, Final Fantasy Tactics remains a cornerstone of the genre and a beloved cult classic that influenced countless tactical RPGs in the years that followed. This is truly one of the best RPGs of all time and a must-play for people who like this genre to any extent, especially if you play using the recent re-releases for modern platforms, as for me I choose to play the original version in the original platform, and to replay it via emulation later in time. This title also has one of the most unique secrets and ester eggs, but I won't spoil anything here so I won't ruin the fun.
