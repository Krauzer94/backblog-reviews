## Punishing Retro Challenge
This is a brutally challenging retro-style platformer inspired by arcade classics like Ghosts ’n Goblins and Rastan. It delivers tight, deliberate controls, pixel-perfect platforming, and an old-school commitment to punishing but fair difficulty. You play as Volgarr, a fierce Viking warrior armed with a sword, shield, and throwable spear, battling through traps, monsters, and treacherous terrain. The game rewards precision and memorization, with every death serving as a lesson rather than a setback caused by unfair design. This game was my first experience playing anything like this ad I really liked it, so I decided to put some other oldschool games on my backlog.

## Nostalgic Mastery Rewarded
Its handcrafted pixel art, fluid animations, and epic orchestral soundtrack perfectly complement its intense gameplay, creating a nostalgic yet polished atmosphere. While its high difficulty will frustrate some players, those who embrace the challenge will find a deeply rewarding and skill-based experience. For fans of uncompromising retro action, Volgarr the Viking stands as a modern classic, and if you liked this one I recommend looking into the sequel, I also recommend doing the NG+ for the real challenge, if you are resilient enough, I admit that was not haha.

## Mastery Through Adversity
Another highlight is the level design, which constantly encourages mastery rather than brute-force persistence. Hidden paths, optional challenges, and multiple endings reward those who take risks and learn enemy patterns instead of rushing forward. Checkpoints are scarce, but they reinforce the arcade mentality the game is clearly aiming for: progress is earned, not handed out. As you improve, sections that once felt impossible become second nature, and that sense of personal growth is one the title's greatest strengths, a similar feeling of old-school titles such as Ninja Gaiden.

## Uncompromising Retro Vision
That said, the game isn’t without its rough edges, the unforgiving nature of its mechanics means there’s little room for experimentation, and newcomers may bounce off before fully appreciating its depth. Still, it knows exactly what it wants to be and never compromises its vision. It’s a game built for people who enjoy discipline, repetition, and the satisfaction of overcoming something genuinely demanding. Even years later, it remains a standout example of how to modernize retro design without losing its soul.
