## Punishing Retro Challenge
This is a brutally challenging retro-style platformer inspired by arcade classics like Ghosts ’n Goblins and Rastan. It delivers tight, deliberate controls, pixel-perfect platforming, and an old-school commitment to punishing but fair difficulty. You play as Volgarr, a fierce Viking warrior armed with a sword, shield, and throwable spear, battling through traps, monsters, and treacherous terrain. The game rewards precision and memorization, with every death serving as a lesson rather than a setback caused by unfair design. This game was my first experience playing anything like this ad I really liked it, so I decided to put some other oldschool games on my backlog.

## Nostalgic Mastery Rewarded
Its handcrafted pixel art, fluid animations, and epic orchestral soundtrack perfectly complement its intense gameplay, creating a nostalgic yet polished atmosphere. While its high difficulty will frustrate some players, those who embrace the challenge will find a deeply rewarding and skill-based experience. For fans of uncompromising retro action, Volgarr the Viking stands as a modern classic, and if you liked this one I recommend looking into the sequel, I also recommend doing the NG+ for the real challenge, if you are resilient enough, I admit that was not haha.
