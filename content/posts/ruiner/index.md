## Relentless Cyberpunk Combat
This is a fast-paced twin-stick shooter set in the cyberpunk city of Rengkok, the game throws you into the role of a masked anti-hero fighting through hordes of enemies in a neon-drenched dystopia. The gameplay is its strongest element, with fluid combat that mixes quick dashes, melee strikes, and a variety of powerful weapons. Encounters are challenging, rewarding quick reflexes and smart use of the environment. Combined with responsive controls and a high skill ceiling, the action feels both brutal and exhilarating.

## Neon Atmosphere and Sound
Visually, Ruiner is striking, its bold red-and-black color palette, heavy use of neon lights, and stylish character designs create an oppressive yet captivating atmosphere. The soundtrack, filled with pulsating electronic and industrial beats, perfectly complements the violent, chaotic gameplay, making every fight feel intense. Especially in the atmosphere and OST department, this game is heavily inspired by what Hotline Miami was trying to do, from the gameplay perspective, so if you like that kind of game I would heavily recommend this one.

## Style Over Story
Where Ruiner falters is in its story though, the narrative is minimal and often cliché, with underdeveloped characters and little emotional weight. Dialogue is sparse and the plot feels more like a backdrop for the action than a driving force. The game is short but tightly paced, while some may find it lacking in replay value, others will appreciate its focused, adrenaline-fueled experience. Overall, this is a stylish and visceral action game that excels in combat and atmosphere but struggles to deliver a memorable story.
