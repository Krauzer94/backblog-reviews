## Hype and Premise
When Watch Dogs launched, it was one of Ubisoft’s most hyped new IPs, promising a futuristic open world where hacking was as powerful as a gun. Set in a near-future version of Chicago controlled by the ctOS surveillance network. The MC is called Aiden Pearce, a vigilante hacker seeking revenge after a personal tragedy.

## Hacking as Power
The biggest strength of Watch Dogs lies in its hacking mechanics. With just a button press, you can manipulate traffic lights, shut down power grids, explode steam pipes, or hijack security cameras to scout ahead. These abilities add a creative layer to missions, allowing multiple approaches beyond standard gunplay. The city itself is dense and atmospheric, with side activities like criminal investigations, digital trips, and online invasions giving the world more variety.

## Limited Player Freedom
And as I said on other reviews, the "freedom" on how to approach each mission, or situation, is not really a very well developed, complex or in-depth feature. In the end it all boils down to, if you want to go guns blazing, or stealth. So don't expect immersive sim levels of freedom, it is just enough freedom to use as an excuse, even though the hacking theme would make it up as an amazing way for more creative and complex approaches. On the downside, the story struggles to keep momentum.

## Ambition Over Execution
Aiden is often criticized as a flat and uncharismatic lead, and the revenge-driven plot feels predictable compared to the game’s innovative premise. The driving mechanics also lack polish, with vehicles handling stiffly compared to other open-world titles of the time. This title is an ambitious first entry that introduced exciting ideas but failed to fully deliver on its potential. It’s still enjoyable for those who like experimenting with hacking mechanics in an open-world setting, but it feels more like a proof of concept than a polished classic.
