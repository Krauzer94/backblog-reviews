## Unreliable Western Narrative
This game is a stylish FPS that blends tight, arcade-inspired gunplay with a unique narrative twist, similar to the good old Wild West movies. The MC is called Silas Greaves, an aging bounty hunter recounting his adventures in a saloon, and the world shifts in real time to match his often unreliable storytelling. This mechanic keeps the levels fresh and unpredictable, adding charm to the brisk pacing.

## Stylish Arcade Gunplay
The shooting feels punchy and satisfying, with skill-based XP rewards for headshots, combos, and creative kills. Unlockable abilities for pistols, rifles, and shotguns add variety, while slow-motion “concentration” mode and cinematic dodges bring flair to firefights, similar to games like Max Payne, which inspired a lot of shooters to use this feature at the time. Its cel-shaded art style and bold colors give it a comic-book feel, and the voice acting brings the tale to life, especially when it comes to the protagonist, since he does a lot of monologues and narrative scenes.

## Short but Memorable
The main campaign lasts about five to seven hours, but the Arcade and Duel modes offer extra replay value, and while they are not challenging sections, it is worth to try and get a better performance on subsequent tries. Some drawbacks include repetitive enemy AI, limited weapon variety, and a few underwhelming boss fights, but these flaws are outweighed by the game’s personality and pacing. This game delivers an engaging, memorable Western shooter experience that’s both fun and replayable, I recommend it if you like shooters in general, and it is also part of the story of another game, so it has it's own universe.
