## Peak Crash Platforming
The last PlayStation Crash title is the third entry of the iconic platformer trilogy, and it's widely regarded as the best of the original series, myself included. It refines the tight level design, responsive controls, and quirky humor that made Crash famous, while introducing new time-travel-themed worlds, vehicle levels, and power-ups that add variety to the gameplay. The visuals were top-notch for the era, with colorful environments and expressive animations. While some vehicle sections can feel clunky, even for the standards at the time, overall, Warped is a polished, creative, and highly entertaining platformer that remains a PlayStation classic.

## Ultimate Completion Challenge
Similar to the previous PlayStation Crash titles, I 100%'ed this one too, and it feels a little more special than the previous titles simply because there are more things to do, collect, more challenges, the sole gameplay variety is enough. Not to mention the high difficulty on some of the levels, especially when it comes to the secret ones that are unlocked after you perform the regular 100%, time trials included. All those secret levels are forever in my memories as one of the hardest platforming levels in all gaming history, or maybe I was just bad at them when I played this game, we'll never know, this is a must play for the PlayStation platform, a must 100%, not just a must play.
