## Wordless Emotional Journey
This game is a visually stunning and emotionally charged indie platformer, It tells the story of a young woman navigating grief, expressed through a wordless journey across surreal, watercolor landscapes that evolve as she regains strength and abilities. There isn't really much of a plot going on, it is a much more artistic game, more than a regular traditional one that has a mainline story and characters, so don't expect much on this regard.

## Art, Music, Mechanics
The game stands out for its breathtaking hand-drawn art and fluid animations, paired with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that reacts dynamically to the player’s progress. Each area introduces new mechanics, such as turning heavy to resist winds or gliding gracefully, all woven seamlessly into the theme of emotional recovery. The puzzles and platforming in general aren't much of a challenge, though this is really not the point this game is trying to make.

## Atmospheric Gameplay Focus
The gameplay is simple and accessible, focusing more on atmosphere and exploration than challenge. There are no enemies, death screens, or complex systems, just gentle platforming and puzzles that emphasize flow and immersion. This makes GRIS feel more like an interactive piece of art than a traditional game.

## Reception and Recommendation
Some people have praised GRIS for its beauty, emotional resonance, and cohesive design, though some note its linearity and short playtime of around four to five hours. Still, for those seeking a meditative and artistically rich experience, GRIS is regarded as one of the most memorable indie releases of its time. I only recommend this one if you are really into alternative games, and stay away if you are looking for anything that isn't even slightly exotic to any extent.
