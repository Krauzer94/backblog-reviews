## Familiar Yet Refined
The third MMX entry for the SNES is a high-octane platformer that builds on the success of its predecessors with tighter controls, new gameplay mechanics, and a greater sense of challenge. The game introduces Zero as a temporary playable character (albeit limited), adding a fresh dynamic to the series, the boss fights remain a highlight, and the ability to collect armor upgrades and ride mechs adds variety. However, it’s often considered less innovative than X or X2, with some level design and music not quite reaching the same heights.

## The Weakest SNES X
This is the weakest MMX from the SNES platform, I can safely say you can skip this one, it is not as "must-play" as the other two previous titles. Though if you are a fan I highly recommend not skipping this one, it is a very enjoyable game even though it has a lot of flaws and it is way less inspiring than previous entries, at the end of the day, this is still MMX, just not the best one that Capcom developed for the SNES platform.
