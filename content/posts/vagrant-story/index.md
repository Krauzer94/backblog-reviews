## Cursed City Intrigue
This is a dark, richly atmospheric action RPG developed by Square, set in the cursed city of Leá Monde, the game follows Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker caught in a tangled web of political intrigue and occult forces. Its standout features include a deep weapon customization system, real-time tactical combat with a unique "Risk" mechanic, and a cinematic presentation rarely seen on the PS1, that is still an impressive feat even for today's standards, even more so because of the limitations of the platform at the time.

## Cult Classic Depth
The game's mature narrative, moody art direction, and Yasumi Matsuno's signature storytelling make it a cult classic, however, its steep learning curve and complex systems can be intimidating to newcomers. Still, for fans of tactical depth and narrative-driven RPGs, Vagrant Story is a rewarding and unforgettable experience, and definitely a must play for JRPG/RPG fans, Square fans, and one of the best games of the PlayStation platform.

## Steep Learning Curve
Though be prepared for a very step learning curve, since almost all mechanics of this game are very unique and hard to translate to other similar titles, it may be somewhat close to what Parasite Even was trying to do. I also recommend playing Final Fantasy Tactics if you enjoyed the world building of this title, since it is set in the same universe, not that this means much when it comes to the isolated things you do in the games, but it is indeed an interesting take when it comes to the creative decision making.
