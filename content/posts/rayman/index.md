## Iconic 2D Debut
The first Rayman entry is a landmark 2D platformer that introduced players to Ubisoft’s now-iconic limbless hero. Set in a lush, imaginative world, the game blends stunning hand-drawn visuals with fluid animation and a distinctive charm that still holds up decades later. Every level bursts with color and personality, from serene forests to bizarre dreamscapes, all complemented by a playful yet atmospheric OST that enhances its fairy-tale mood.

## Surprisingly Brutal Difficulty
While Rayman may look inviting, it quickly reveals a steep difficulty curve, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this was one of the most difficult games I've played in my life. It is so hard that, in order to finish the game, I admit that I had to use cheat codes, otherwise it would be a nightmarish experience during the late-game stages. Its precise platforming, tricky enemy placement, and limited continues demand both patience and skill.

## Rewarding Classic Platformer
However, that challenge adds to its lasting appeal, making each completed level feel genuinely rewarding. The game’s simple mechanics, jumping, punching, and later gliding, are used cleverly throughout, ensuring the gameplay stays fresh and inventive. As one of the most visually impressive and artistically ambitious titles of its time, this game remains a defining entry in the platformer genre. It established a beloved franchise and proved that even in the era of 3D gaming’s rise, 2D artistry and tight design could still deliver a magical and memorable experience.
