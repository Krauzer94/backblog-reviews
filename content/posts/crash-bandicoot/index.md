## PlayStation Platforming Landmark
This PS1 title is a landmark platformer developed by Naughty Dog that helped define the original PlayStation era for this entire genre. Featuring vibrant 3D environments, tight level design, and a quirky protagonist, the game introduced players to challenging linear stages filled with hazards, collectibles, and enemies. While the controls could feel stiff at times and the difficulty could spike unexpectedly, its charm, colorful graphics, and catchy soundtrack made it a fan favorite. It laid the groundwork for a beloved franchise and solidified Crash as a PlayStation icon.

## Brutal Yet Charming
Particularly speaking, this is my least favorite one, simply because of it's insane difficulty in some levels, even though I love hard games, this one is especially hard. Though this is literally my only complain, the rest of the game is simply fantastic, even for today's standards, there are titles which are inspired by the first Crash entry, not to mention the unique soundtrack, which helps you don't get bored of dying a lot of times over and over. Another flaw I can think of is having fewer secrets and collectibles compared to the later entries, though understandable since this was the first gamble on this formula.
