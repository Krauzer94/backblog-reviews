## Dual-Protagonist Stealth Focus
This Tenchu etry is a stealth-action game that continues the dark, atmospheric tradition of the Tenchu series, set in feudal Japan. This installment shifts focus to two female protagonists, Ayame, a returning assassin from previous games, and Rin, a streetwise newcomer seeking revenge. The dual storyline is one of the game’s stronger elements, offering contrasting perspectives and a bit more narrative depth than past entries. Gameplay remains centered on stealth, patience, and precision, missions reward silent kills and careful planning, allowing you to perform cinematic stealth kills that feel brutal and satisfying.

## Aging Design Limitations
The environments, small villages, forests, and fortresses, are well designed for sneaking, though the level layouts can feel repetitive. The addition of cooperative stealth kills and non-lethal takedowns gives some welcome variety to the formula. Unfortunately, this game also shows its age, the graphics and animations look dated even for 2004, and the camera and control scheme can be frustrating in tight spaces.

## Flawed but Atmospheric Stealth
Enemy AI is inconsistent, sometimes sharp, other times oblivious, and this undermines the sense of tension that defines a great stealth game. Despite its flaws, this Tenchu entry delivers a moody, atmospheric experience that fans of classic stealth titles may still appreciate. It’s a slower, more methodical game that rewards patience and timing, though it lacks the refinement to stand out beyond its niche. Unfortunately this franchise never got the love it deserves so we don't really get any new releases, or re-releases, for modern platforms with QOL improvements or easier ways to access this historical stealth game.
