## Magnetic Steampunk Atmosphere
This title is a 2D puzzle-platformer that revolves around the manipulation of magnetism. Set in a steampunk-inspired world filled with hand-drawn environments, it tells its story entirely without dialogue, relying instead on environmental cues, animation, and visual storytelling. The atmosphere is rich and mysterious, supported by a beautifully painted art style and an evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the tone. What made me want to play this was it's artstyle, that while unique, it continues to be it's strongest point when compared to the other mechanics.

## Creative but Frustrating
The game’s magnetic mechanics are both its greatest strength and main challenge. You must use attraction and repulsion to navigate puzzles and traverse complex environments, which can feel rewarding when mastered. However, the physics-based controls sometimes lack precision, and a few of the later puzzles or boss fights can become frustrating due to their high difficulty and reliance on trial and error. By far the weakest aspect are the boss fights, they don't feel natural or engaging enough, it was a nice try to implement a more traditional element into the game.

## Charming Yet Imperfect
Despite these rough edges, Teslagrad stands out as a creative and atmospheric indie title. Its unique mechanics, visual charm, and wordless storytelling make it memorable, even if its short length and occasional frustration prevent it from reaching true greatness. I can't say this is a bad experience, but I also cannot praise this more than I wish I could, it is a nice and unique indie title, reserved for fans of the indie scene if you, like me, consider yourself one.
