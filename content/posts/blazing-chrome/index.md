## Retro Run-and-Gun Revival
This game is a love letter to classic run-and-gun shooters like Contra and Metal Slug. Developed by Brazilian studio JoyMasher (which I'm a big fan of), it delivers fast-paced side-scrolling action with tight controls, challenging enemy patterns, and explosive boss fights. The game’s retro-styled pixel art and chiptune-inspired soundtrack capture the look and feel of the 16-bit era while adding modern polish. The OST of this game is brilliant, same level as the classics that inspired it, and I'm really not exaggerating.

## Fast, Cooperative Chaos
The gameplay emphasizes quick reflexes, varied weapon choices, and cooperative play, with both local coop and unlockable characters adding replay value. Fortunately I could experience the coop with a friend, though he lost interest once we beat this the first time, even though there were new playable characters afterwards. Though I highly recommend replaying with them since they change the gameplay a lot. Difficulty levels range from approachable to hardcore, making it accessible for newcomers while still satisfying genre veterans.

## Short but Impactful
On the downside, the campaign is short, with only six stages that can be finished in just a few hours. Some critics also noted that the game leans heavily on nostalgia without bringing many new ideas to the genre. In hectic moments, the screen can feel cluttered, occasionally making it hard to follow the action. Overall, Blazing Chrome succeeds as a faithful homage to its inspirations. This is a must-play for fans of the run-and-gun genre, or even just for the nostalgia alone, and finally I also highly recommend looking into the other JoyMasher titles, they are very high quality retro love letters.
