## Modern Retro Tribute
This game is a retro-inspired action-platformer by Brazilian studio JoyMasher that pays clear homage to classics like Castlevania and Ghosts ’n Goblins. With beautifully detailed 8-bit style pixel art and a moody chiptune soundtrack, it successfully captures the atmosphere of the NES era while adding modern polish to mechanics and pacing. I'm a big fan of this developer, and I'll forever recommend their games, they are a joy for people who love retro, traditional, simpler video-game, and I'm also biased because of it's origin country.

## Polished Classic Gameplay
The game blends straightforward platforming with light Metroidvania elements, featuring branching levels, hidden areas, and abilities that encourage revisiting earlier stages. It is a very pleasant experience to 100% this title, I highly recommend it, since it is not a very complex and time demanding title, which makes it a good fit for a post-credits experience. Combat is tight and responsive, with sub-weapons and upgrades adding variety to the action, boss fights are well-designed, requiring pattern recognition without feeling unfair, and checkpoints keep frustration at bay.

## Concise Dark Adventure
While the story of Haggis, a retired warrior seeking to save his son from demonic forces, is simple, it’s presented with atmospheric cutscenes that fit the dark fantasy tone, however, the main plot has a nice twist at the end (no spoilers). The campaign runs about five to six hours, making it a concise but satisfying experience, with an optional harder mode for those craving more challenge. Some people praised the game, often calling it one of the best modern “Castlevania-like” titles. Its combination of nostalgic style, fair difficulty, and polished design make it a standout indie release that remains highly recommended for fans of retro action adventures.
