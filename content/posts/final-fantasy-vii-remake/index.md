## A Modern Reimagining
This title is a masterful reimagining of the beloved 1997 classic, blending nostalgia with modern gameplay innovations. The game takes the first portion of the original story and expands it with richer environments, fully realized character models, and cinematic cutscenes that make Midgar feel alive like never before. The level of detail in the world design, from bustling streets to sprawling slums, showcases the capabilities of modern PC hardware, delivering an immersive visual experience for both longtime fans and newcomers.

## Hybrid Combat Evolution
The combat system is a notable departure from the original turn-based mechanics, combining real-time action with tactical elements. You can switch between party members on the fly, use abilities strategically via the ATB system, and execute cinematic Limit Breaks. This hybrid approach allows for both fast-paced combat and careful planning, making encounters satisfying and engaging. While many praise this evolution, some fans of the original’s classic turn-based style may find the new system initially challenging to adapt to.

## Expanded Narrative Depth
Though this will only be an issue if you not familiar in any way to action games in general, which is very rare not to be familiar with nowadays. Narratively, the remake expands on the story of Cloud, Aerith, and the rest of the team, giving side characters more depth and introducing new plot threads. This added content enriches the storytelling and emotional impact, although it can alter the pacing compared to the original. For those who appreciate character-driven narratives will likely enjoy these expansions, while some purists may find certain deviations from the source material unexpected.

## Music and Performances
The OST, which blends reimagined classics with new compositions, is another highlight, complementing the emotional weight and intensity of the story. Voice acting is strong across the cast, particularly for the main characters, adding another layer of immersion. This is a rare case which you can switch between the Japanese and the English dubs and you'll have a good time on both experiences. In summary, this remake is a visually stunning and narratively rich reimagining that modernizes one of the most beloved RPGs of all time.

## An Exceptional Remake
While it has minor technical issues and pacing adjustments, its innovative combat system, expanded story, and breathtaking presentation make it a must-play experience for both fans of the original and newcomers alike. FFVII was one of my first RPGs of all time, and I consider it to be one of the best video-games ever made, so I was shocked when this remake was announced. Amazing that they were able to completely destroy my expectations in a good way, this is definitely one of the best remakes the gaming industry has ever experienced. Also, don't sleep on the optional Yuffie content, it is one of the best optional content I've ever experienced.
