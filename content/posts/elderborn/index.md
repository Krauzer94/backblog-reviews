## Brutal Melee Focus
This title is a first-person melee action game, it combines a heavy-metal aesthetic with “souls-like” combat mechanics and old-school level design, focusing entirely on close-quarters combat rather than ranged attacks. The game’s atmosphere is distinct, brutal, stylish, and drenched in metal music, giving it a unique tone that stands out among other indie titles of its era. The combat is the clear highlight, weapons feel heavy, strikes are satisfying, and timing your attacks, parries, and dodges brings a rewarding sense of rhythm. A lot of people praised how the gameplay feels impactful once you master the mechanics.

## Linear but Stylish
The world design, while linear, has a handcrafted charm, and the OST complements the action perfectly. The overall experience is concise, lasting around eight to ten hours, which works in its favor by keeping the pacing tight. On the downside, Elderborn can feel repetitive due to limited enemy variety and occasionally awkward level design. Some people found the combat animations a bit clunky, and the story is minimal, more a backdrop than a driving force. It’s a game that lives and dies by its combat system, and if you don’t click with its melee focus, there isn’t much else to keep you engaged.

## A Short Hidden Gem
Overall, this game is a solid indie experience for fans of skill-based, first-person melee combat. It’s stylish, fast and even if a bit rough around the edges. For people seeking a short but intense action fix, it’s a hidden gem worth checking out, a focused. If you even remotely like the idea of a brutal first-person melee game than you can't find a better one than this. I would also recommend this for fans of the Soulslike genre since it has all of it's elements, despite the heavy change of gameplay perspective, it still feels like one.
