## Action RPG Overview
A charming and fast-paced action RPG, featuring several developers who previously worked on the Diablo series, which, at the time, was one of it's main selling points. It offers a familiar yet fresh experience, with intuitive controls, a loot-driven progression system, and highly accessible gameplay. Set in the mining town of Torchlight, you can choose from three character classes, Alchemist (mage), Destroyer (warrior) and Vanquisher (archer), delve into increasingly challenging randomized dungeons, at the time I choose to play as the Destroyer.

## Visuals and Companions
The game’s cartoony visual style and vibrant color palette give it a distinct personality, setting it apart from the darker tone of its genre peers. The soundtrack, composed by Matt Uelmen (Diablo, Diablo II), adds a moody and atmospheric layer that enhances the dungeon-crawling experience. One of the standout features is the pet companion, which can not only assist in combat but also carry items back to town to sell, streamlining inventory management and improving the game's progression pacing.

## Story and Replayability
The story is serviceable but not a major focus, taking a backseat to the loot and action. Overall, Torchlight is a polished and addictive ARPG that delivers a satisfying experience, especially for fans of Diablo-style games. Its simplicity, charm, and replayability make it a standout indie title from its time.
