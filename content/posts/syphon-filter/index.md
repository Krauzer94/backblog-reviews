## Tense Stealth Atmosphere
The game's standout features are its tense atmosphere, surprisingly complex AI for its era, and a wide arsenal of weapons, including the iconic taser that can literally set enemies on fire if you hold the trigger too long. Its controls are a bit clunky by modern standards, especially aiming and movement, but they were manageable once you got used to them. Visually, it hasn’t aged gracefully, but it’s a solid reminder of how ambitious late-’90s games could be. The story is surprisingly engaging, with a serious tone and a shadowy, late-Cold-War paranoia vibe. Despite the rough edges, Syphon Filter was ahead of its time. It's not as slick as Metal Gear Solid, but it earns its cult status through bold design choices, intense gameplay, and a lot of charm. A must-play for PS1 fans who want to see how early stealth-action games evolved.
