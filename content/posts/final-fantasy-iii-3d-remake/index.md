## Classic JRPG Charm
This FF entry offers a charming and nostalgic RPG experience with updated 3D visuals, originally developed for the original NES. The turn-based combat and classic job system are highlights, allowing for strategic flexibility as your party evolves. While the story is fairly simple and the difficulty can spike without grinding, the game captures the spirit of early JRPGs. The PC version runs smoothly, with improved resolution and controller support, but the dated animations and repetitive music may not appeal to everyone. Though this is something only a person that is not a JRPG fan would say, so stay away from this one if you are not

## First FF Experience
This was the very first FF title that I played, which is from the "classic" era of the NES, and I knew I was in for a good time, loved the job system, it gives you a very good sense of progression, and makes you want to experience with different parties. And while I wish Square continued using this mechanic, I'm also glad they decided to create more unique entries afterwards, and decided to abandon this formula. I guess I'm a sucker for JRPGs which tries to incorporate TTRPG mechanics such as very well defined party roles, jobs and a progress system similar to the classic FF crystal ones.
