## Metal-Fueled Worldbuilding
This game is an ambitious and unconventional game that blends action-adventure combat, open-world exploration, and real-time strategy in a world completely inspired by heavy metal. The MC is called Eddie Riggs, voiced with great energy by Jack Black, a roadie who gets transported into a fantasy realm built from the imagery of album covers, guitars, and stage pyrotechnics. The game’s personality shines through its writing, humor, and sheer dedication to celebrating metal culture, with cameos from legends like Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy Kilmister adding to its authenticity.

## Great Combat, Divisive RTS
The soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular, packed with classic and underground metal tracks that elevate every battle and road trip across its stylized landscapes. Combat with Eddie’s axe and guitar feels satisfying, and driving the customizable "Druid Plow" through hordes of enemies is a joy. However, the game’s sudden reliance on large-scale real-time strategy battles can be divisive. These sections often feel less refined and clash with the otherwise smooth hack-and-slash experience, and particularly speaking this made me drop the game.

## Flawed Yet Memorable
In my opinion, this game would be almost perfect if the RTS sections were removed, and this is not just be, a lot of people feel the same way, unfortunately. Still, Brütal Legend remains a cult classic for its creativity, atmosphere, and unapologetic devotion to metal. It’s a flawed but unforgettable experience, more memorable for its world, characters, and music than for its mechanics. For fans of heavy metal or quirky, personality-driven games, it’s an adventure well worth taking, especially for metal-heads like myself, I really wanted to say this is a must-play, but again, the RTS sections are preventing me from doing so.
