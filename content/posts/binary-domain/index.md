## Solid but Unremarkable
This title offers a solid mix of third-person shooting and sci-fi storytelling, but it doesn't quite stand out in the genre. The gameplay is functional, with cover-based mechanics that feel a bit dated (immensely over-used at the time because of Gears of War), especially compared to more polished shooters from that era. The story, centered around the question of what it means to be human in a world of advanced AI, has its moments but never fully engages.

## Missed Potential
The characters, while decent, lack depth, and the game's choice-based dialogue system feels more like a gimmick than a meaningful feature. Overall, Binary Domain is an average experience, nothing groundbreaking, but enjoyable for fans of the genre who don't mind a few rough edges. It had good ideas when it comes to the squad-based gameplay mechanics, but unfortunately they were poorly implemented, I would not recommend this one.
