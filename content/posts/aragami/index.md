## Shadow-Based Stealth
This title is a third-person stealth action game which you play as Aragami, an undead assassin with the ability to manipulate shadows, offering a fresh and engaging approach to stealth gameplay. The game emphasizes avoiding direct combat, using powers like shadow teleportation, invisibility, and summoning shadow creatures to navigate levels undetected.

## Stylized Atmosphere
The art style is heavily influenced by Japanese aesthetics, featuring stylized environments and characters. The soundtrack complements the visuals, enhancing the immersive and atmospheric experience. Levels are designed to reward patience and strategic planning, though some critics noted that enemy AI can be simplistic at times, which slightly reduces the challenge in certain scenarios.

## Simple Yet Memorable
Although it is a very simplistic and short game, it is still very enjoyable for fans of stealth games, not all of them need to be overly complex to have high quality. Overall, Aragami received generally favorable reviews for its innovative mechanics and artistic direction. While it has minor technical flaws and occasional shallow design moments, it stands out as a memorable indie stealth game.
