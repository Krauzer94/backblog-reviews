## A Timeless First Experience
Let me just start off by saying this is the best game of all time, in my opinion, and it lives forever in my heart as the experience I wished the most I could forget, so I can experience this for the first time all over again, multiple times. I'm glad I never played this back in the day, because I would never enjoy the experience of not understanding the story because of the language barrier. So I ended up emulating the SNES version a few years ago, though I recommend getting the more recent versions instead, they are some good QOL improvements that are very worth having.

## Masterful Time-Travel Tale
Chrono Trigger is, without a doubt, one of the greatest video games ever made, arguably the best of all time. From the moment you begin, the game’s masterful storytelling immediately captivates you, weaving an intricate time-traveling narrative that spans prehistoric eras, futuristic cities, and apocalyptic futures. Every character feels alive, with distinct personalities, motivations, and arcs that make you genuinely care about their journey. In my opinion, the characters are the actual standout, even though the story is the best aspect, the main cast is really the ones that carry the plot, on an insane level of charisma.

## Music, Choices, Combat
Not to mention their music themes, and the OST is simple one of the best, if not the best, out of all games that I've played, it is one of those that you save the songs to listen as a playlist, similar to Undertale or Deltarune ones too. The multiple endings give the story incredible depth and replay value, allowing each choice to leave a meaningful impact on the world. Its battle system, a revolutionary take on the active-time combat mechanic, is both strategic and fluid, with the innovative combination attacks between party members adding layers of tactical brilliance.

## Simple Yet Satisfying Combat
At first the combat may seem very simplistic, and even though it is not a very challenging game, it still manages to make the combat a very pleasant experience, with insane levels of damage combos, though don't expect a complex system such as traditional JRPG classes and equipment combinations, this is more of an adventure title dressed as a JRPG. If you think that a complex battle system is a must, such as ones seen in Chrono Cross for example, than this title won't appeal to you at all.

## Timeless Artistry
The visuals, crafted with charming 16-bit sprites by Akira Toriyama, remain timeless, giving each location a unique and unforgettable personality. Meanwhile, Yasunori Mitsuda’s and Nobuo Uematsu’s score is nothing short of iconic, perfectly conveying the game’s sense of adventure, wonder, and emotional weight. Even decades after its release, Chrono Trigger stands as a flawless example of what a video game can achieve, blending narrative, gameplay, music, and design into a singular, transcendent experience.

## Perfection in Game Form
And while I admit that Final Fantasy VII was the one that made videogame become real art, outside the videogame bubble at the time, in my opinion, Chrono Trigger is the most advanced game on this regard. It's charm alone carries a heavy weight, not just from the nostalgic point of view (not to mention I've never played this back in the day anyway). For anyone who appreciates the art of gaming, it is not just a classic, it is perfection.
