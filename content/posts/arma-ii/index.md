## Realistic Military Simulation
This is a military simulation game, not a regular FPS, at the time it was known for its realism, it features large-scale combat, detailed ballistics, and tactical squad gameplay. The massive open world and modding support (which gave rise to DayZ) make it a standout for hardcore players, which later introduced even more mods such as PUBG and such.

## Overwhelming Mod Experience
And I have more experience trying to play the mods than the game itself, because I had to admit that this video-game was way too hardcore for me to even start to understand what the hell was going on. At the time I didn't knew much english, so it became an even harder challenge for me to enjoy this title, it was a complete nightmare and I never gave it another chance.

## Groundbreaking but Challenging
Despite its flaws, Arma II is a groundbreaking title that helped define the military sim genre, I got into it because of some friends at the time that were fans of the game, so they made me try it out, unfortunately I need to set a low score for this one because of my experience, not because of the quality of the video-game itself.
