## Paper World Innovation
This title is an RPG that stands out for its unique style and accessible gameplay, it introduces a world where everything looks like it’s made of paper, characters, scenery, and effects, which gave the game a playful, storybook atmosphere. This was a bold stylistic choice at the time, and it helped Paper Mario stand apart from both traditional Mario platformers and other role-playing games. This really has a feel like a sequel to the Mario RPG from the SNES, not just because of it's combat mechanics, but on a overall gameplay feel, so if you liked the ones from SNES, then there is no excuse not to play this one.

## Charming Classic Story
The story is straightforward, Bowser has stolen the Star Rod and captured Princess Peach, and Mario must gather the power of the Star Spirits to defeat him, but it’s told with a surprising amount of humor and charm. Along the way, Mario is joined by a variety of partners, each with their own personalities and abilities, such as Goombario with his headbonk or Bombette with her explosive skills. So again, this really feels like the SNES counterpart down to the pacing and characters. These partners aren’t just helpful in combat but are also key to solving puzzles in the overworld, which keeps exploration fresh.

## Interactive Turn-Based Combat
Combat uses a turn-based system but adds timing-based action commands, where pressing a button at the right moment can increase damage or reduce it when defending. This mechanic keeps battles interactive and more engaging than the typical “select attack and wait” style found in many RPGs of that era. This makes up for a much more dynamic combat system, while at the same time, being accessible enough because it doesn't really introduces a lot of complexity. The badge system also provides customization, letting players adjust Mario’s abilities to fit their playstyle, adding some depth to the combat features.

## Accessible RPG Classic
While it isn’t as complex or lengthy as other RPGs like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger, Paper Mario succeeds through its balance of accessibility, lighthearted storytelling, and polished design. Its mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and character-driven humor makes it one of the standout titles on the Nintendo 64, and it laid the groundwork for what would become one of Nintendo’s most beloved RPG series. This is definitely one of the best RPGs that I've played, but I'm biased since I like alternative games, so if you are expecting a traditional RPG, or even JRPG, then I would stay away from this one, but this is a must-play for Mario fans. I would also recommend trying to play the most recent re-releases, as for me, I decided to play the vanilla original 64 version.
