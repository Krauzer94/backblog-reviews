## Creeping Psychological Horror
This title is a psychological survival horror game that draws heavy inspiration from classics like Clock Tower and Silent Hill. You play as Rosemary Reed, a determined woman investigating the mysterious disappearance of a young girl, leading her to a creepy mansion filled with disturbing secrets. The game excels in atmosphere, with tense audio design, eerie lighting, and unsettling enemies.

## Strong Atmosphere, Weak Mechanics
The stealth-based gameplay encourages patience and caution, but some clunky mechanics and repetitive segments can break immersion, and this is the main point which made me have a bad time on this one. While I'm about to criticize this game a lot, I really liked the overall design if this title, it is what made me become interested in the game in the first place, not just the visual design but also the sound and effects, just not the animations though, they are dated and not really well made.

## Disappointing Survival Experience
I really hated the mechanics, I'm a survival horror fan and I can totally enjoy titles such as Haunting Grounds and Clock Tower, but this one is not one of them. Unlike the already mentioned titles, this one has very little mechanics in comparison, to a point where it becomes boring to interact with the already not-so-many existing ones. I highly recommend skipping this one, only exception is if you really like "stalker horror" titles, which, while I'm not really a fan of, I can indeed enjoy this kind of game, just not this one.
