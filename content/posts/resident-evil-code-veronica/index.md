## Narrative-Driven Survival Horror
This RE entry is a standout in the series, blending classic survival horror with a deeper narrative and improved 3D graphics over its predecessors. The MC is Claire Redfield and later Chris, exploring eerie environments filled with puzzles, limited resources, and terrifying creatures. The game’s atmosphere is tense and immersive, and its cinematic cutscenes add emotional depth. While the controls and camera angles feel dated by modern standards, the compelling story and challenging gameplay make it a memorable experience for fans of the genre.

## Peak Classic Evolution
This is one of my favorite RE titles, it is the perfect evolution of the formula of the PlayStation 1 era, while at the same time, it is very close to what the games did back then. Not that it needed much improvement at the time, but the visuals made the experience much more enjoyable, not to mention that having better visuals helps a lot inn the horror genre. This is definitely one of the best games of the PlayStation 2 platform, and a must-play for RE fans.
