## Sniping in North Africa
The 3rd Sniper Elite mainline entry is a tactical third-person shooter, set in the North African theater of World War II. And the setting itself is not a very common approach to WWII games, most of them tend to focus on other periods and places, but it is clear why this was the chosen one for this title, it is a perfect place for a sniper game. It shifts away from the more constrained levels of earlier entries and embraces large, open environments that reward observation, patience, and smart positioning. You are encouraged to scout areas with binoculars, tag enemies, and plan routes before taking a shot, which reinforces the fantasy of being an elite sniper behind enemy lines.

## Refined Tactical Mechanics
And while this is my 2nd Sniper Elite game, I can safely say that this is a complete evolution compared to the V2 previous title. The sniping mechanics are the highlight, once again, bullet physics take wind, gravity, and distance into account, making long-range shots feel earned rather than automatic. The iconic X-ray kill cam returns in full force, graphically showcasing successful shots in slow motion and adding a unique sense of impact to precision kills. Environmental elements, such as generators, explosions, and sandstorms, can be used to mask shots, further deepening the tactical layer of gameplay. This makes up for a much more dynamic gameplay, compared to previous entries, you have a lot of options to enhance your stealth capabilities.

## Open-Ended Stealth Gameplay
Though at the same time, you have far more enemies, not to mention it adds a lot of vehicles for you to deal with, on every single level, which forces you to be creative in your executions. Stealth is generally well implemented, you are able to eliminate enemies silently, set traps, or avoid confrontation entirely. The open-ended level design allows for multiple playstyles, whether focusing on careful sniping from afar or methodically clearing areas up close. It as some coop features, but particularly I never touched this aspect and decided to face this title as a single-player game instead. I usually tend to go for the stealth approach, but there are some levels which requires more patience than others due to the lack of resources to mask your shots. One of my favorite features is the loadout system, even though it is somewhat limited, it enhances replayability and freedom to how you approach each mission.

## Pacing and AI Issues
And this approach helped a lot to mitigate the very slow pace these games can sometimes have, which although I tend to appreciate, it can sometimes be tiring if you don't have enough creative ways to approach combat. One of my biggest complaints is the artificial intelligence being one of the downsides, and not one isolated to this title, it has already become a trait of this franchise. And while I understand that this aspect is a very hard one to be implemented, it is still one of the most important ones for games that consider themselves to be of the stealth genre. And for a sniper game, it for sure needs to be faced as a stealth game, first and foremost. The enemy AI can also be inconsistent, sometimes reacting unrealistically or failing to properly respond to threats

## Focused but Flawed Experience
The story is minimal and largely forgettable, serving more as a backdrop than a compelling narrative. Close-quarters combat and cover shooting feel serviceable but lack the refinement of the sniping mechanics, and mission objectives can become repetitive over time. Overall, this game is a focused and enjoyable experience for people who appreciate slow, deliberate gameplay and tactical freedom. While it doesn’t excel in storytelling or technical polish, it succeeds in delivering a satisfying sniper-centric experience that stands out within the WWII shooter genre. If you liked the previous entries to this franchise, there is little to no excuses not to play this one. It is definitely not a must-play, or a ground-breaking stealth shooter, but it still makes me want to play the other titles of this franchise.
