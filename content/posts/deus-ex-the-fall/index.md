## A Weaker Deus Ex
This Deus Ex entry felt like a watered-down version of the main series, coming from the mobile platform, the game didn’t translate well to PC. Clunky controls, outdated graphics, and awkward AI made it hard to stay engaged. The story had potential, but the execution felt flat, and the limited environments didn’t help. I tried to get into it, but it never clicked, and I ended up dropping it pretty quickly, it just didn’t live up to the Deus Ex name.

## Limited Player Agency
Another major issue was the lack of meaningful player choice, which is a core pillar of the Deus Ex identity. Levels felt restrictive and linear, offering few alternative paths or creative solutions to problems. Augmentations existed, but their impact was limited, making progression feel shallow rather than empowering. Instead of encouraging experimentation, the game often pushed you down a single, obvious route, stripping away the sense of agency that defines the series.

## Technical and Structural Issues
Technical problems and missing features further hurt the experience, menus and interfaces clearly retained their mobile roots, feeling cumbersome and unintuitive with other input formats. On top of that, the abrupt ending, widely known to be incomplete, left the narrative feeling unresolved and unsatisfying. This title came across less as a spin-off and more as a compromised port, making it difficult to recommend to fans of the franchise.
