## A Weaker Deus Ex
This Deus Ex entry felt like a watered-down version of the main series, coming from the mobile platform, the game didn’t translate well to PC. Clunky controls, outdated graphics, and awkward AI made it hard to stay engaged. The story had potential, but the execution felt flat, and the limited environments didn’t help. I tried to get into it, but it never clicked, and I ended up dropping it pretty quickly, it just didn’t live up to the Deus Ex name.
