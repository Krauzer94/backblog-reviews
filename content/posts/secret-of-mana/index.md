## Action RPG Pioneer
This title is one of Square’s most iconic action RPGs, praised for blending fast-paced combat with an accessible, storybook-like adventure. Unlike the traditional turn-based RPGs of its era, it features real-time battles where timing and positioning matter, creating a more dynamic feel. For today's standards this may not sound like a big deal, but this title set new standards to action RPGs at the time, especially because of how complex the combat could get, compared to more simpler titles such as ALTTP.

## Ring Menu Innovation
The innovative ring menu system (also used in Secret of Evermore) allows players to pause the action briefly to equip weapons, cast spells, or use items, keeping the pace fluid without overwhelming the player. The game also shines in its cooperative multiplayer, letting up to three players join forces, a rare and highly memorable feature for the genre at the time. Unfortunately I never experienced the coop experience since I never played this back in the day, and I choose the original version of this game to play, but I highly recommend the newer versions which are more accessible, for modern platforms.

## Charm Over Flaws
Its vibrant pixel art and expressive animations give the world a sense of warmth and charm, while the soundtrack is still celebrated for its emotional range, from mysterious forest themes to grand battle tracks. That said, Secret of Mana isn’t without flaws, hit detection can feel imprecise, and AI-controlled companions often struggle to keep up in combat. Still, these issues are outweighed by the game’s sense of wonder, accessibility, and cooperative spirit. Decades later, it remains a standout in the SNES library and a milestone in the evolution of action RPGs, this is a must-play for fans of JRPG in general, and I suggest going with the re-releases for modern platforms, don't skip this.
