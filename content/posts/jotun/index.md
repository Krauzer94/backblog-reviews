## Mythic Art and Atmosphere
This game is a hand-drawn action-adventure game rooted in Norse mythology, the MC is called Thora, a fallen warrior seeking to prove herself to the gods. Its most striking feature is the gorgeous, animated art style that makes every environment and battle feel like a moving painting. The Icelandic narration and sweeping soundtrack add to its immersive and authentic atmosphere. What made me interested in this game was it's art-style, and I stayed because of the gameplay, even though I'm not a fan of the boss-rush genre, I quickly feel in love with this, and a couple of other similar titles.

## Epic Jötnar Encounters
The real highlights of the game are its massive boss fights against elemental giants, the Jötnar. These encounters are epic in scale, demanding patience and careful timing to overcome, somewhat like the Soulslike sub-genre titles. Between battles, exploration offers a slower pace, with vast landscapes to traverse, though some people may find these sections sparse or repetitive I quite like them since it helps out to balance the pacing of the frantic boss battles.

## Simple Yet Memorable
Combat is deliberately simple, with light and heavy attacks, dodges, and a few divine powers. While this keeps the focus on scale and spectacle, it can also feels somewhat clunky and limited, especially during tougher fights where precision matters. Overall, Jotun is a short but memorable experience, similar to a lot of other boss-rush games. It shines with its art, atmosphere, and sense of mythic greatness. For people who enjoy mythology and striking visuals, it remains a unique indie gem, a no-brainer if you like the boss-rush genre to any extent.
