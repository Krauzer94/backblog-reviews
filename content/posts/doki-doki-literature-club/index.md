## Deceptive Visual Novel
This game is a free-to-play visual novel that starts as a cheerful dating simulator but gradually evolves into a deeply unsettling psychological horror experience, it subverts traditional visual novel tropes, delivering a story that is both innovative and disturbing. I confess that this is the first and only VN that I've ever played, this genre never sparkled any interest in me, and I only played this one because of the hype surrounding it, a rare occasion, and I quite enjoyed it though I don't see myself playing any other VN in the future.

## Meta Horror Narrative
The game follows a high school student who joins a literature club at the encouragement of his childhood friend, Sayori. As he interacts with the club members, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika. The player engages in writing poems and building relationships, beneath the surface, however, the game introduces fourth-wall-breaking elements and explores themes of mental health and existential dread, creating a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is eerie. I can safely say that, for the proposal of the story, using the VN format was absolutely the perfect fit for this title, I can even dare to say that it wouldn't work on any other format.

## Genre-Defining Impact
This game has a bold storytelling and its ability to transform a familiar genre into a medium for psychological horror, in my opinion it rivals titles such as Silent Hill, despite it's "exotic" format. Its unexpected twists and meta-narrative have left a lasting impression on the gaming community. For people seeking a unique narrative experience that combines charm with genuine horror, this title offers an unforgettable journey that lingers long after the game ends. I highly recommend this for fans VNs in general, which I doubt they never heard of, but I especially recommend this for people who are not fans of the genre, since it can even make you fall in love with it, or at the very least, experience one of the best and most unique indie titles in gaming history.
