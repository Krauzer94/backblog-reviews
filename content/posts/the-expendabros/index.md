## Explosive Run-and-Gun
The Expendabros makes a strong first impression with its chaotic, over-the-top action and charming pixel-art style. Right from the start, the game throws you into explosive side-scrolling mayhem where nearly everything is destructible, and each character, parodies of action movie stars, feels distinct thanks to their unique weapons and abilities. It’s fast, loud, and gleefully ridiculous, capturing that old-school run-and-gun energy perfectly.

## Polished Chaotic Fun
I played through the first couple of hours and definitely saw the appeal. The short missions, constant character switching, and creative level design show that there’s real polish behind the chaos. The humor and self-awareness help sell the concept too, this is a game that knows exactly what it is and leans all the way in.

## Shallow Long-Term Appeal
That said, the novelty started to wear off for me after a while, even with different characters and explosive variety, the core loop felt a bit shallow once the initial excitement faded. I didn’t feel strongly compelled to keep going, especially without any real progression system or story hooks to hold my attention. Fun in bursts, but not quite enough to keep me playing long-term.
