## Promising Then Collapses
This game is one of those games that tricks you with a decent premise and then completely falls apart the moment you start playing. I couldn’t even push past the first hour, it was that bad. The atmosphere tries so hard to be moody and tense, but it’s undercut by laughably stiff animations, awful voice acting, and painfully generic writing.

## Combat and Controls
Combat is an absolute chore. Swinging a melee weapon feels like controlling a drunk robot, and enemies have all the intelligence of cardboard cutouts. Nothing about it feels responsive or satisfying. I spent more time fighting the controls than any actual threats. The game bombards you with clunky tutorials and lifeless corridors that all look the same, and by the time it tried to introduce anything remotely interesting, I had already checked out.

## Technical Breakdown
Technically, the game is a mess, performance is unstable even on modern machines, with frequent stuttering and odd physics glitches that constantly pull you out of whatever immersion the game is desperately trying to build. Visual effects that were probably meant to look impressive by the time of its release, now just look muddy and unfinished, and the lighting, crucial for horror games, often works against itself, either obscuring everything or exposing how bare the environments really are.

## Wasted Potential
What’s most frustrating is the wasted potential, there are clear hints of ideas inspired by better post-apocalyptic and horror titles, but none of them are given the polish or care they need to work. This title feels less like a forgotten cult classic and more like an unfinished prototype that somehow made it to release. Instead of tension or fear, it mostly inspires disbelief that it shipped in this state, and relief when you finally decide to uninstall it.
