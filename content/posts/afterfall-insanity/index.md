## Promising Then Collapses
This game is one of those games that tricks you with a decent premise and then completely falls apart the moment you start playing. I couldn’t even push past the first hour, it was that bad. The atmosphere tries so hard to be moody and tense, but it’s undercut by laughably stiff animations, awful voice acting, and painfully generic writing.

## Combat and Controls
Combat is an absolute chore. Swinging a melee weapon feels like controlling a drunk robot, and enemies have all the intelligence of cardboard cutouts. Nothing about it feels responsive or satisfying. I spent more time fighting the controls than any actual threats. The game bombards you with clunky tutorials and lifeless corridors that all look the same, and by the time it tried to introduce anything remotely interesting, I had already checked out.
