## Cinematic Time-Travel Finale
This game is a stylish and ambitious conclusion to the Onimusha trilogy, blending samurai-era Japan with modern-day Paris through an unexpected but entertaining time-travel storyline. There are two MCs this time, Samanosuke Akechi, and French cop Jacques Blanc, played by Jean Reno, in a dual narrative that adds variety and cinematic flair, which was already a not very unique trait at the time, but nevertheless it was still a very fun mechanics if implemented with a good pacing.

## Polished Action Evolution
The game refines the series’ action gameplay with smoother controls and full 3D environments, a big improvement over the pre-rendered backgrounds of its predecessors. Combat remains fast and satisfying, with elemental weapons, flashy finishers, and light puzzle-solving. While the time travel plot can get cheesy and some voice acting is uneven, Onimusha 3 delivers a polished, fun hack-and-slash experience with strong visuals for its time and a memorable East-meets-West twist.

## Highly Replayable Classic
This was another title that I replayed a lot, the PlayStation 2 had one of the best replayable games of all time, and this is no exception, there are tons of things to find and unlock, not to mention the upgrades you can perform. And if you want to see everything you need to replay it, and in order for it not to be a boring process Capcom made it a not so long title, with a very dynamic pacing, which doesn't let the player get tired, but it also brings a satisfying challenge to the table.
