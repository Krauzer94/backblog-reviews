## Ezio’s Brotherhood Rises
This AC entry is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed II, so the MC is yet again Ezio on a journey in Renaissance Italy. Set primarily in Rome, the game refines the series’ formula by introducing squad-based mechanics, Ezio can recruit and train fellow assassins, adding a new strategic layer to missions. I enjoyed this mechanic very much, especially since it felt like the perfect fit for the lore of the game, taking into account the first title that we are introduced by an order and it's members.

## Rome Refined and Alive
The city of Rome is richly detailed and massive, offering numerous side quests, collectibles, and territory control mechanics, and I think this one strikes a good balance in side-content, especially compared to the more modern titles, which are longer than they should be, for no good reason. The combat is more fluid and aggressive, and the story balances historical intrigue with the series’ sci-fi narrative arc.

## A Polished Sequel
While not a radical departure from its predecessor, Brotherhood stands out for its polished gameplay, meaningful progression systems, and surprisingly robust multiplayer mode—a first for the franchise, it even added a multiplayer mode, which fit perfectly into the proposal of this title, was quite nice but not really my thing. This is a refined and content-rich sequel that expands on AC II’s strengths without losing its narrative momentum.
