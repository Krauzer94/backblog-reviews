## Expanded Survival Horror
This Capcom title is a survival horror classic that built upon its predecessor’s foundation with greater ambition and polish, using a new setting, a zombie-infested Raccoon City, it follows Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield through two interwoven campaigns. The game impressed with its cinematic presentation, atmospheric pre-rendered backgrounds, and intense resource management. Its "Zapping System", allowing two different story perspectives, added strong replay value. Despite stiff tank controls and fixed camera angles, Resident Evil 2 remains a defining entry in the genre and one of the PlayStation’s finest horror experiences.

## Tension Through Innovation
It builds up on everything that the first title did correctly, and tries to implement new ideas, such as more playable characters, on both of the already two playable campaigns, that while lasting for a short time, have a very unique gameplay mechanic and is important for the development of the main plot. This was the first RE title which introduced the "Nemesis" mechanic, which was improved on later titles, and is a perfect fit for what Capcom was trying to make, especially what they were trying to make the player feel, which is the complete opposite of being at ease. A classic must-play for the PlayStation platform, and for survival-horror fans in general.
