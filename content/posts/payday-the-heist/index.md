## Cooperative Heist Action
The first PayDay title is a cooperative FPS that offers a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled experience where you and up to three other players execute high-stakes robberies, like bank heists and hostage rescues. The gameplay blends tactical shooting with objective-based missions that demand teamwork and coordination.

## Rough Yet Thrilling
While the AI can be clunky in solo play, the game truly shines in co-op, thanks to its chaotic yet thrilling scenarios and replayability. The graphics and UI feel dated today, but the core loop remains engaging. For fans of cooperative shooters and heist fantasies, it’s a gritty and satisfying ride, especially if you don't mind some rough edges. As a first attempt on this formula, this game was a big standout back in the day when it was released, and if you are invested into this one, I also recommend grabbing the second title, which expands upon every aspect of this one.

## Built For Co-op
I also advise you find somebody to play with since all the core mechanics surrounding the experience heavily rely on this. This is one of those titles you often come back to, it doesn't matter the community size, similar to modern giants such as Deep Rock Galactic, though way less mature since it is, again, the first entry of this franchise's formula.
