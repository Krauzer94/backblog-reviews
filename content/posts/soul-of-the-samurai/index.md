## Samurai Horror Premise
This is an action-adventure title developed by Konami that mixes historical samurai drama with supernatural horror. The game lets you choose between two characters, Kotaro, a wandering samurai, and Lin, a female ninja, with each offering a slightly different perspective on the same unfolding story. I introduces a bit of a optional side-content to each character, which is very well hidden and I highly recommend going through them since they are very rewarding and worth experiencing.

## Proto-Onimusha Gameplay
The gameplay is reminiscent of survival horror titles like Resident Evil, with fixed camera angles and tank-style controls. However, instead of firearms, combat is centered around melee swordplay, requiring careful timing and positioning. I can safely say this pretty much feels like an alpha version of what Onimusha came to be, but with PlayStation 1 technology, which for lovers of the platform like myself, is a very awesome recipe. The atmosphere is one of the game's strengths, drawing players into a stylized, eerie version of feudal Japan filled with undead enemies and demonic forces.

## Flawed but Memorable
Despite its intriguing premise and unique tone, the game suffers from dated controls, stiff animations, and a relatively short campaign, which were both common traits of games at the time, and I would only complain about this if we compared them to more recent titles. Enemy variety is limited, and the camera angles can be frustrating during combat, especially during boss-fights, which there is a surprising amount of them. Still, for fans of classic PlayStation-era action games or samurai lore, this game holds nostalgic value and offers an experience that stands out for its setting and mood, even if it never reached the heights of Konami’s more famous titles.
