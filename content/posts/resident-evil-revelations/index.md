## Classic Horror Revival
This is a refined port of the original 3DS title that attempts to bridge the gap between the series’ survival horror roots and its more action-oriented modern entries. Set mostly aboard the derelict Queen Zenobia cruise ship, the game creates a claustrophobic and eerie atmosphere reminiscent of the early PlayStation-era Resident Evil titles. The confined corridors, limited resources, and puzzle-solving elements evoke a sense of tension that fans of classic Resident Evil will find familiar, which at the time was a standout since the RE community didn't really liked how more action-oriented the series was becoming.

## Balanced Action Horror
The PC version benefits from upgraded visuals, including higher-resolution textures and more detailed environments compared to its handheld origins. And this is the first and only version of this game that I played, so I don't have any nostalgia for it, even though, I consider this one of the best RE experiences since it strikes an almost perfect balance of action and horror. While the story is somewhat pulpy and over-the-top, a trait of this franchise to be honest, it is presented in an episodic format that helps maintain pacing and suspense, similar to something like Alan Wake, though without all the visual appeal of mimicking a real TV series.

## Replayable Combat Modes
Combat is a blend of strategic aiming and straightforward shooting mechanics, with some segments leaning more heavily into action. The mechanics of this game are very familiar for those who played RE4 in the PlayStation 2, it really feels like Capcom reused a lot of things of that title, such as animations and game assets, which is not a bummer in my opinion since I loved it. The inclusion of Raid Mode adds a layer of replayability, allowing you to tackle combat-focused challenges with a variety of characters and weapons. Overall, this RE entry is a solid title that successfully combines elements of horror and action, making it a worthwhile experience for both longtime fans and newer players.
