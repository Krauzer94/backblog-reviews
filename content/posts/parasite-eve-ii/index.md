## Action-Horror Evolution
Departing from the first game's more RPG-heavy structure, the sequel leans closer to Resident Evil-style gameplay, with fixed camera angles, real-time combat, and tank controls. The MC is still Aya Brea, now an MIST agent, battling mutated creatures born from Neo-Mitochondria, the game combines tense atmosphere, solid visuals for its time, and a more action-focused experience compared to its predecessor. The Parasite Energy system offers some character progression and strategy, though less nuanced than the original.

## Divisive Yet Compelling
While some fans missed the deeper narrative and RPG systems of the first game, Parasite Eve II is still a compelling and stylish horror game, especially for fans of late-'90s survival horror, a flawed but fascinating hybrid of action and horror with strong atmosphere and sci-fi intrigue. I simply cannot decide which Parasite Eve I like the most, from the PlayStation platform, both are simply very unique, fun and have amazing stories, not to mention their replay value, which made me play them several times up until now.

## Action vs RPG Appeal
Besides this, the second title is the one I played and replayed the most, simply because it is more action-oriented, so more fast-paced, but I'm also a JRPG fan so the first title is one of my favorite games of the PlayStation era. This game was stunning at the time, playing like a RE title but having way more complex mechanics, the not to mention it gave more meaning when it comes to the combat, since there is a leveling system compared to regular survival-horror titles, similar to something like Koudelka, from the same platform.
