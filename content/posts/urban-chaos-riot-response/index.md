## Urban Riot Warfare
This is a gritty, first-person tactical shooter developed by Rocksteady Studios, set in a crime-ridden city torn apart by riots, the MC is called Nick Mason, a member of an elite anti-riot police unit. The game emphasizes brutal, up-close action with a mix of lethal and non-lethal weapons, riot shields, and squad-based tactics, which back in the day was one of it's selling points because this level of violence was not very common at the time.

## Brutal Tactical Action
Its gameplay is intense and fast-paced, blending arcade-style shooting with tactical decision-making, such as rescuing hostages, securing areas, and working with AI-controlled allies like firefighters or paramedics. The use of riot shields and stun weapons adds a unique flair, encouraging you to disarm rather than always kill. I'm a fan of the bonus missions you had to perform in order to unlock new tools to help you progress the main mission, this gives you a little extra level of complexity and replayability, and they are definitely not a walk in the park.

## Cult Tactical Shooter
While it delivers a satisfying and aggressive combat experience, it falls short in areas like enemy and ally AI, repetitive mission structure, and average visuals for its time. Still, it's responsive controls, and adrenaline-pumping action make it a cult favorite among fans of tactical shooters. It’s not a masterpiece, but it has a distinct style that sets it apart from more conventional military games of the era, didn't set any standards but it is still one of the best titles of the PlayStation 2 platform.
