## Polished HD Platforming
This title takes the classic 2D Mario platforming formula and gives it a fresh coat of HD polish. It’s the first side-scrolling Mario game rendered in full high definition, and the visuals are clean, colorful, and packed with charming background details that make the game world feel more alive than ever. The level design is smart and varied, mixing traditional platforming challenges with inventive twists that reward both newcomers and veterans who enjoy hunting for secret exits and Star Coins.

## Fresh Suits and Yoshis
The new Flying Squirrel Suit is a highlight, offering both a fun sense of mobility and skill-based control that enhances vertical level exploration. Yoshi also returns in several forms, including baby Yoshis with unique abilities, adding extra variety to the gameplay. The difficulty curve feels perfectly tuned, accessible enough for casual play, yet with hidden challenges that push experienced players.

## Refined Mario Experience
Though it doesn’t drastically innovate beyond New Super Mario Bros. Wii, this entry stands out as the most polished and complete version of the formula, a confident, joyful platformer that celebrates everything great about 2D Mario design. This is definitely a must-play if you like platformers to any extent, and a highly praised Mario entry for fans of the franchise. I recommend going 100% on this one, it has some very nice hidden secrets, levels and extra-content to ramp up the game's playtime a little, since it is a not a long one to begin with.
