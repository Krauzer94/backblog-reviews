## Frustrating First Impressions
The very first Lords of the Fallen entry tries to capture the dark, methodical combat of the Souls-like genre, but I struggled to get into it. The early hours felt frustrating rather than challenging, with slow pacing and clunky controls that made each encounter more tedious than rewarding. The world design has some interesting moments, but the oppressive atmosphere didn’t quite draw me in. Enemy placement and repeated backtracking made progress feel more like a chore, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that the game was trying too hard to mimic its inspirations without adding much of its own.

## A Failed Soulslike Attempt
I'm a Soulslike fan but this one is simply a bad attempt on replicating the formula, the feeling of gameplay is very bad, even when using a controller, the classes are not interesting, neither are the weapons and skills. Overall, I couldn’t make it past the first few hours, the combination of technical hiccups, punishing difficulty spikes, and monotonous gameplay left me feeling more frustrated than engaged. It’s a game I wanted to enjoy, but it just didn’t click for me. I don't recommend this one, and I heard good things about the reboot, I would advise looking into it instead.
