## A Polished Sequel
The second Torchlight entry is a fast-paced action RPG developed by Runic Games, offering a polished and accessible alternative to Diablo III, which unfortunately for the Runic Games team, was released very closely. Set in a colorful steampunk-fantasy world, it expands on the original with four distinct classes, compared to three from the previous entry, co-op multiplayer, which was not a thing before, and sprawling open zones, giving a sense of open-worldness.

## Refined Gameplay Systems
The gameplay shines with fluid combat, deep loot systems, and pet companions that can fight and sell your junk, expanding upon the features of the first title. Modding support and a vibrant art style give it lasting appeal. While the story is fairly generic, the satisfying progression and replayability make it a standout in the genre.

## Personal Genre Shift
As much as I like to praise this game, I got to admit that I couldn't bare to finish it, because personally speaking, when this game came out, I was becoming a Dark Souls fan, so for me, this version of action-RPG, which is more Diablo-like, lives in the past, and I simply cannot enjoy this anymore. Though this is totally a personal take on this, overall Torchlight II is a good entry to the series, that is, if you are a fan of this format, which is not the case for me anymore.
