## Faithful Yet Limited Adaptation
The very first Metro videogame entry is a gritty, atmospheric first-person shooter based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel with the same name, which I also read, though only after I played the game. Set in post-apocalyptic Moscow, it plunges players into the dark, claustrophobic tunnels of the metro system, where humanity clings to survival amid radiation, mutants, and political strife. As with all book inspired games, this one cannot explore the story enough to satisfy the readers, though I'm confident enough when I say this one is the best adaptation we could have in the format of a video-game.

## Atmosphere Over Mechanics
The game excels in immersive world-building, with haunting environments and a strong narrative. Combat can feel clunky at times, unfortunately even for the standards at the time, and the stealth mechanics are a bit rough. But the oppressive atmosphere, excellent sound design, and survival-horror tension more than make up for it. It's not for everyone, but fans of story-driven shooters and bleak sci-fi settings will find it memorable, I highly recommend not skipping this one since it introduces you to a lot of things related to the world of Metro, that later sequels expanded upon.

## Survival Through Scarcity
A big part of what makes this game stand out is how it treats resources and difficulty as narrative tools rather than mere gameplay systems. Ammunition is scarce, filters run out at the worst moments, and every bullet fired feels like a decision with consequences. This constant pressure reinforces the sense of vulnerability and desperation, making even short excursions into the surface feel genuinely stressful. It’s a design choice that may frustrate some people, but it fits perfectly with the game’s themes of survival and decay. Particularly I love when games do this, more than power fantasy styled ones.

## Atmosphere Over Polish
As for the visuals, the game shows its age in places, yet its artistic direction still holds up remarkably well. The lighting, use of darkness, and attention to small environmental details create a distinct identity that many shooters lack. The moral choices, while subtle and often opaque, add an extra layer of depth and encourage reflection rather than clear-cut decisions. As a starting point for the series, this title may be rough around the edges, but its ambition and atmosphere laid the foundation for one of the most distinctive post-apocalyptic universes in gaming.
