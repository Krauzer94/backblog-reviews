## Faithful Yet Limited Adaptation
The very first Metro videogame entry is a gritty, atmospheric first-person shooter based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel with the same name, which I also read, though only after I played the game. Set in post-apocalyptic Moscow, it plunges players into the dark, claustrophobic tunnels of the metro system, where humanity clings to survival amid radiation, mutants, and political strife. As with all book inspired games, this one cannot explore the story enough to satisfy the readers, though I'm confident enough when I say this one is the best adaptation we could have in the format of a video-game.

## Atmosphere Over Mechanics
The game excels in immersive world-building, with haunting environments and a strong narrative. Combat can feel clunky at times, unfortunately even for the standards at the time, and the stealth mechanics are a bit rough. But the oppressive atmosphere, excellent sound design, and survival-horror tension more than make up for it. It's not for everyone, but fans of story-driven shooters and bleak sci-fi settings will find it memorable, I highly recommend not skipping this one since it introduces you to a lot of things related to the world of Metro, that later sequels expanded upon.
