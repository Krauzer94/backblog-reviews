## Psychological Horror Masterpiece
This videogame is a masterclass in psychological horror, unlike many survival horror games of its era, it focuses less on jump scares and more on atmosphere, emotion, and psychological dread. This story's MC is James Sunderland, you explore the fog-shrouded town after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, leading to a haunting and deeply symbolic journey, which is still a reference when it comes to story-telling through all gaming history. The game's visuals, audio design, and eerie OST create an oppressive and unforgettable mood. Its slow pacing, cryptic narrative, and disturbing enemies (like the iconic Pyramid Head) elevate it beyond typical horror.

## Timeless Survival Horror
This was the SH entry which popularized this iconic character, referenced in so many other games yet today. While the combat and controls can feel clunky by modern standards, they're serviceable and arguably add to the vulnerability the game intends, and a good enough improvement compared to the first entry in the PlayStation 1 platform. I highly recommend playing this for any survival horror fan, on any platform possible, not just the recently released remake, but this OG entry, because it is still indeed one of the gaming's best experiences you can find, a timeless masterpiece.
