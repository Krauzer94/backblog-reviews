## Gothic Metroidvania Excellence
This Castlevania entry for the Nintendo DS is a standout entry in the long-running series, blending classic 2D action-platforming with RPG elements and a rich gothic atmosphere, one of the many entries inspired by the SOTN formula, which I just can't get enough. A direct sequel to Aria of Sorrow, the MC this time is Soma Cruz as he grapples with his dark powers and a cult seeking to resurrect Dracula. It refines the Tactical Soul system, allowing for deep customization and varied combat styles, visually, it pushes the DS hardware with detailed sprites and moody environments.

## Flawed Touch, Timeless Design
While the touch screen elements (like drawing seals to finish bosses) feel a bit forced, and I'm really not a fan of this mechanic, the tight gameplay, memorable soundtrack, and strong level design make it one of the best Metroidvania titles on the system. This is easily a must-play for fans of SOTN, or Metroidvanias in general, and I'll say the same to all the other similar Castlevania titles, because this formula never gets old.
