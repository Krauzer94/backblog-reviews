## Horror-RPG Fusion
Parasite Eve is a unique mix of survival horror and turn-based RPG elements, developed by SquareSoft, set in a hauntingly atmospheric New York City, the story follows NYPD officer Aya Brea as she investigates mysterious combustions linked to an ancient mitochondrial entity named Eve. The game stands out with its cinematic presentation, haunting soundtrack, and a real-time battle system that adds tension and strategy. It combines horror storytelling with Square’s signature RPG mechanics, creating a compelling and mature narrative, and in my opinion it hasn't aged a day, it is still a blast to go through even for today's standards. Though I got to admit that I have a soft spot for Resident Evil and JRPGs, so I might be just the right target audience for this one.

## Cult Classic Appeal
While the game is relatively short and linear, its bold genre fusion and memorable boss fights make it a cult classic of the PS1 era, it's especially recommended for fans of Final Fantasy and Resident Evil looking for something in between, and as I already said, just the perfect mix for my taste. I remember not being able to progress further than the first few stages because of the english knowledge limitation, but I managed to pull it off when I replayed it on modern platforms, not just that but I had a lot of fun grinding some levels to be able to make Aya OP since her powers are very fun to use.
