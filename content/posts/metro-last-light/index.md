## Immersive Post-Apocalypse
The second Metro entry is a FPS that masterfully blends survival horror, stealth, and action in a post-apocalyptic Moscow. Picking up where Metro 2033 left off, it immerses you in the tunnels and ruins of a devastated world, with striking environmental detail, haunting lighting, and a palpable sense of tension at every turn. The game’s story is compelling, driven by morally complex choices that shape its ending, while its characters are surprisingly well-developed for the genre.

## Tactical Stealth Combat
Combat is tense and deliberate, rewarding careful planning and resource management, though the game still allows for more action-oriented playstyles. And although using a "stealth x non-stealth" shooter approach at the time was becoming old by the time of this release, this one is masterfully implemented. You have tons of options to approach the "full-stealth" playstyle, and sometimes this is the only viable option, depending on the difficulty level you choose to play this.

## Atmospheric Narrative Journey
You even face a couple of bosses along the way, nothing over the top but they add a nice change of pace from the regular gameplay rythm. While linear in design, the tightly crafted levels and atmospheric storytelling make it a standout experience, particularly for people who appreciate a gripping narrative combined with moments of genuine fear and suspense. The art direction, sound design, and attention to survival mechanics elevate Metro: Last Light beyond a typical shooter into a fully immersive world, this one is a must play for those who like single-player story shooters to any extent.
