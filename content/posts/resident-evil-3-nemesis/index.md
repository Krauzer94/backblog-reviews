## Relentless Survival Horror
This title is a thrilling survival horror classic that builds on the tension and atmosphere of its predecessors, set in a zombie-ravaged Raccoon City, the MC is, yet again, Jill Valentine, trying to escape while being relentlessly pursued by the terrifying Nemesis, a near-invincible bio-weapon that adds constant pressure and fear. The game refines the series' mechanics with improved controls, a dodge move, and the ability to craft ammo, making combat slightly more dynamic. The fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds maintain a cinematic feel, though they can occasionally hinder visibility.

## Iconic Nemesis Replayability
While the story is straightforward, the pacing is excellent, and the Nemesis encounters elevate the tension. It’s a bit shorter than Resident Evil 2, but its replayability and iconic moments make it a standout entry in the series. I have high nostalgia for this title in particular because I spent way too many hours replaying it with my friends back in the day, and we could never get tired of it because it was a very fun experience. Not that the previous titles were boring, but this one had a higher level of adventure feel, so at the same time, it was easier to skim through it several times without noticing.

## Choices And Variety
One of the best feature in my opinion, coming from the second title, is having multiple playable characters, the sections where you play as Carlos are very fun, it brings up even more replayability since you can achieve his objective in various different ways, not to mention his gameplay is very different if compared to the stock Jill one that you play since the beginning. Another cool addition are the interactive cutscenes, which, yet again, brings up replay value since you can have different out comes depending on your decision.
