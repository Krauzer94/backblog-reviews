## Brutal Classic Challenge
This game is a brutally challenging side-scrolling action-platformer developed by Capcom, the MC is called Arthur, a knight who must battle through hordes of undead and demonic enemies to rescue a princess, so a very generic plot. It is famous for its punishing difficulty: precise jumps, enemy swarms, and no mid-level checkpoints push players to their limits, and even though I consider myself to have an above average skill when it comes to platforming, this game beat my ass. This is also a trait of the PlayStation 2 title called Maximo, which is a spiritual successor, I highly recommend it.

## Golden Era Craftsmanship
The double jump mechanic was a standout feature at the time, adding depth to platforming, the gothic visuals and eerie soundtrack enhance the dark fantasy atmosphere, and the SNES upgrade brought colorful, detailed sprites and smoother animations over its arcade predecessors. I consider this 2D era of Capcom to be one of the most creative and highest quality pixel-art of all time. I mentioned this on other reviews and I can't stress this enough, this was one of Capcom's golden era. There is also replay value since you can beat the secret boss if you are willing to do some things on a second run, I confess that I didn't bothered to try, so a single run was enough for me.
