## Animated Disney Showcase
This game is a beautifully animated platformer that takes you through classic Mickey Mouse cartoons, like Steamboat Willie and The Mad Doctor, this title showcases impressive visuals for the SNES era, with fluid sprite animations and creative level designs inspired by Disney’s rich history, the amount of animations, and how detailed they are, was a jaw-dropping feature at the time.

## Classic Platforming Nostalgia
As for the gameplay, it offers standard platforming mechanics, jumping, throwing marbles, and avoiding enemies, with some clever set pieces, though the controls can feel slightly stiff and hit detection isn’t always perfect. The game’s difficulty is moderate, with some tricky sections that require patience, some of those are more related to the aforementioned limitations at the time, overall, it's a nostalgic, visually charming experience that stands out for its artistic tribute to Mickey's animated legacy.
