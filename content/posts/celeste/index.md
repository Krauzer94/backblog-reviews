## Precision Platforming Excellence
This game is a standout indie platformer on PC that balances demanding gameplay with a surprisingly touching story. On the surface, it’s a precision platformer, the MC is called Madeline on her climb up the mysterious Celeste Mountain. The controls are simple, jump, dash, and climb, but the way these mechanics are layered creates an incredible amount of depth. Even though the formula is so simply that is even considered saturated nowadays, it is masterfully executed, proving that we don't need to escalate game complexity in order to deliver an amazing gaming experience.

## Challenge With Meaning
Every level introduces new twists that keep the challenge fresh, and while it can be brutally difficult, it never feels unfair. Each failure is a lesson, and every success feels immensely rewarding. What makes Celeste truly special, though, is its emotional core, the game explores themes like anxiety, depression, and self-doubt in a way that’s sincere and relatable, giving the climb symbolic weight. I cannot related to the main point this game is trying to make since I've never experienced any of that, but I can totally see this hitting hard if you have lived any of the mental issues this game is trying to convey.

## Mechanical and Emotional Harmony
Madeline’s personal struggles mirror the obstacles the player faces, making progress feel both mechanical and emotional. This is reinforced by gorgeous pixel art and a phenomenal soundtrack, which shifts between tranquil and intense depending on the moment. This game really has almost zero to no flaws, the art, pacing, difficulty, level design and OST, it is simply one of the highest quality the gaming industry has every provided.

## A Human Ascent
Ultimately, this is more than just a tough platformer, it’s a deeply human story wrapped in clever design, it sets a new bar on videogame storytelling, I highly recommend not skipping this one if you like platformers to any extend. I also recommend trying to 100% it, but only if you like masochist-level of difficulty, though the little secrets here and there (like the Piko8 cartridges) are already enough for some people. Fun fact: this game was originally developed using the Piko8 game-engine, which was originally intended to be used as a prototyping engine.
