## Handheld Metroidvania Excellence
This Castlevania entry for the classic handheld is widely regarded as one of the best entries in the Castlevania franchise and a defining title for the Game Boy Advance. Building on the exploration-focused design popularized by Symphony of the Night, it delivers a tightly paced Metroidvania experience with fluid controls, responsive combat, and detailed pixel art that stands out even among other titles with similar level of quality. The game successfully balances accessibility for newcomers with enough depth to satisfy long-time fans of the series. And this a wonder achievement when it is understood that this is supposed to be a handheld title, not a regular console title, and yet it leaves nothing to be desired when compared to its peers.

## Tactical Soul Innovation
One of its most notable innovations is the Tactical Soul System, which allows the MC, called Soma, to absorb the souls of defeated enemies and use their abilities. This mechanic is somewhat similar to the one found in Order of Ecclesia, which in order to unlock new weapons, you need to farm enemy souls. But instead of weapons, in Aria of Sorrow, these souls are divided into different categories, affecting attacks, movement, and passive bonuses, giving you a wide range of customization options. This system adds strategic variety to combat and exploration, encouraging experimentation and allowing you to tailor their playstyle rather than relying solely on traditional weapon upgrades. This feature, while not revolutionary, it is very well implemented, it has just about enough complexity to not become overwhelming, especially for its target platform.

## Refined Castle Exploration
The castle design is compact compared to some other Metroidvania titles, but it is thoughtfully structured, with strong visual identity across areas and well-placed progression gates. Exploration feels rewarding thanks to hidden rooms, optional challenges, and multiple endings that depend on your choices and mastery of mechanics. So when it comes to being a "IgaVania", there is really almost no surprises here, and this is absolutely not a bad thing since this formula is simply amazing, when well implemented. The game’s pacing avoids long stretches of backtracking, keeping momentum high throughout the adventure. About my only complain about the visuals is that it feels too colorful, particularly I prefer a more dark approach, closer to SOTN.

## Unique Storytelling Twist
As for the story, it stands out by placing its story in a futuristic setting rather than medieval Europe, introducing themes of reincarnation and destiny that refresh the series’ lore. A bit of a spoiler but, the game has two endings, and I highly recommend going for both of them, since it isn't really that difficult. I really enjoy this aspect of this franchise, it is one of the best when it comes to replayability, the backtracking, investigation and secrets are one of the highlight features in my opinion. I'll also indulge the curiosity by saying that, the protagonist of this particular title is simply the most unique one in the entire franchise, but no spoilers, this has to be experienced first hand.

## Soundtrack and Lasting Impact
Though you don't really interact with the aspect of the era that everything happens since the entire game happens inside the castle. The OST complements the experience with a mix of atmospheric and energetic tracks, which is another traditional trait of the IgaVanias, to have a killer soundtrack, this one is no exception. Although some people may find the need to farm certain souls tedious, this minor flaw does little to diminish the overall experience. In summary, this title is a polished, creative, and highly replayable classic that remains a benchmark for handheld action-platformers. It is definitely a must-play if you are a fan of the Castlevania franchise, I played the original Game Boy Advance version, and it leaves nothing to be desired.
