## Cinematic Sci-Fi Mystery
This title is one of the most ambitious cinematic platformers of its era, a game that bridged the gap between traditional 2D action and the emerging world of story-driven, film-like experiences. The MC is called Conrad B. Hart, a young agent who wakes up on an alien planet with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As the mystery unfolds, you piece together his identity and uncover a plot involving alien infiltration and political conspiracy. As much as the videogame industry is immensely saturated with amnesia tropes, this is without a doubt, one of the most unique experiences when it comes to it's narrative.

## Rotoscoped Visual Mastery
On the SNES, Flashback retains the game's signature rotoscoped animation, which was groundbreaking at the time. The team behind this displayed a great deal of evolution when it comes to their previous delivery, which was Out of This World (or, Another World), which both use the exact same art-style and animations. Every movement, from running and climbing to drawing your gun, is smooth and realistic, lending the game a unique cinematic quality. The environments are richly detailed, with futuristic cities, jungles, and alien landscapes that create a strong sense of atmosphere, even within the system’s limited color palette.

## Deliberate Platforming Challenge
As for the gameplay, it blends platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Unlike typical action games of the early ’90s, it rewards patience and observation over reflexes. Movement is deliberate and grid-based, meaning timing and precision are essential for climbing ledges, dodging traps, and engaging enemies. I advise an insane amount of patience when playing this, not only because of how old this game is, but even for the standards at the time, it's implementation and genre makes it so that you get frustrated for trying to perform the utmost basic actions.

## Tense Minimalist Combat
The combat is simple but tense, with your energy shield and pistol serving as your lifeline in a hostile world. There is but only a single weapon, with infinite ammo, and while this may sound appealing, you cannot go guns blazing. The shield can be recharged on certain areas, which is somewhat like a checkpoint for a quick breather, enabling you to be hit at least five times before the game-over screen. And lastly, later on in the game you'll find an item that can stop enemy projectiles, making the combat a bit more dynamic from that point onward.

## Atmospheric Narrative World
Between the action, you’ll interact with NPCs, use items, and navigate dialogue sequences that feel more akin to an adventure game than a standard platformer. The story-telling is a highlight, told through cinematic cutscenes, mysterious journals, and Conrad’s own discoveries. It captures the tone of classic sci-fi films like Blade Runner and Total Recall, mixing cyberpunk aesthetics with philosophical undertones about identity and humanity. The music and sound design reinforce this mood, with atmospheric effects and a hauntingly minimalist soundtrack. This is one of the titles that helped define the "retro" landscape when it comes to it's aesthetic. It is something that will stick to the back of your mind when you listen to things like Synthwave for example.

## Timeless but Demanding
That said, this is absolutely not an easy game, the controls can feel stiff and unforgiving to modern players, and trial-and-error is often required to progress. Still, mastering its rhythm is part of the appeal, it’s a product of an era when games expected you to learn through failure and persistence. Overall, this game remains a landmark in cinematic storytelling and animation in video games. Its combination of atmospheric design, thoughtful pacing, and sci-fi intrigue makes it a timeless experience, even if its dated controls and difficulty may deter newcomers. For fans of classic adventures and 16-bit experimentation, it’s a must-play piece of gaming history.
