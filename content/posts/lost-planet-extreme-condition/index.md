## Frozen World Warfare
This title is a third-person shooter set on the frozen planet E.D.N. III, where humanity battles both the harsh climate and giant insect-like creatures known as the Akrid. The game’s icy setting gives it a distinctive atmosphere, with blizzards, crumbling bases, and vast snowy plains rendered impressively for its time. The use of thermal energy as both a survival mechanic and gameplay resource adds tension, forcing you to stay aggressive in order to stay alive. Combat feels dynamic, especially when piloting the massive “Vital Suits,” which let you wield heavy weapons and battle towering bosses.

## Spectacle With Flaws
The enemy designs and scale of encounters often feel cinematic, giving a sense of constant danger and spectacle. However, despite the strong presentation, the game suffers from repetitive mission structures and uneven pacing, with levels that can feel linear and overly similar. The story, centered on revenge and corporate conspiracies, serves more as a backdrop than a driving force. Despite its flaws, this game remains a memorable action experience thanks to its unique setting and ambitious visuals, even if its gameplay loop doesn’t quite live up to its striking premise.

## Underrated Franchise Legacy
It was one of the last games that I played on my very first computer, and it ran very poorly, but I struggled through the low-FPS count from start to finish because I was thrilled with the gameplay, especially when it comes to the mecha feature. This is one of the most unique Capcom's titles and I wished this franchise had more care and love by it's developers. Unfortunately they let this great idea die out after three entries, in which the 3rd one felt more like a Dead Space clone than an actual Lost Planet entry. If you are interested on this franchise I recommend sticking to the first entry, that while rough around the edges, it still delivers a better experience than it's two sequels.
