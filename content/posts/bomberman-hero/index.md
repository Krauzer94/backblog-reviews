## Daring 3D Reinvention
This title took a daring step away from the franchise’s tried-and-true multiplayer formula, venturing into full 3D single-player platforming territory. It transforms Bomberman’s familiar bomb-based gameplay into a more expansive adventure — one that feels closer to Super Mario 64 or Crash Bandicoot than the grid-based arenas fans were used to. And despite me being a fan of the original formula, I also forever thought about playing a more traditional Bomberman, such as this one, and despite it's flaws, I loved the the style.

## Ambitious Planet-Spanning Story
The story is surprisingly ambitious for a Bomberman game. You play as the heroic Bomberman, who sets off across several planets to rescue Princess Millian and recover a stolen data disk containing critical information. This intergalactic journey takes you through a variety of colorful worlds, from snowy landscapes and lava-filled caverns to futuristic bases, each packed with enemies, hazards, and secrets to uncover.

## Platforming and Gadgets
Gameplay revolves around precise platforming, bomb-throwing combat, and light puzzle-solving. You gains access to new moves and gadgets, like a jetpack and underwater gear, which keep the action varied and lively. Though you can only access these gadgets during some predetermined sections of the game, specifically, you play through some levels using them, from start to finish. The controls are responsive, though the fixed camera can occasionally make platforming tricky.

## Single-Player Focused Design
Unlike most Bomberman titles, this one completely omits the trademark multiplayer mode, which disappointed some fans but allowed the developers to focus on crafting a cohesive, story-driven experience. Particularly I never minded it not having a MP mode, I highly value a polished single-player campaign over one. One of the standout aspects of this is its OST. The energetic blend of electronic, drum ‘n’ bass, and ambient tracks perfectly complements the game’s fast-paced, futuristic vibe.

## Underrated N64 Experiment
While the game can feel repetitive in its level structure and lacks the depth of other 3D platformers of its era, its charm, music, and smooth gameplay give it a distinct identity within the series. This game may not be the definitive Bomberman experience, but it’s an underrated gem, a creative and confident experiment that still stands out in the N64 library for its unique mix of action and style. I highly recommend not skipping this one if you are a like of 3D platformers to any extent, despite it's short length and levels, it is still a very enjoyable experience.
