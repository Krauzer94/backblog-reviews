## Analog Control Innovation
The 1st Ape Escape entry is a groundbreaking platformer that remains memorable for its unique gameplay and inventive use of the DualShock controller. As the first game to require analog sticks, it fully leverages the left stick for movement and the right stick for controlling a variety of gadgets, creating a control scheme that was revolutionary at the time. I remember having a hard time learning how to use both analog sticks in the PlayStation 2 era, and I never played Ape Escape back in the day, so I'm glad I played it very late so I was already used to the dual-analog sticks.

## Playful Time-Travel Platforming
The MC is called Spike, tasked with capturing mischievous monkeys who have escaped through time using a range of creative tools, from nets to stun gadgets. The game shines with its colorful and imaginative level design, each area filled with puzzles, hidden collectibles, and secret monkeys to catch, encouraging exploration and replayability. Its whimsical sense of humor, quirky characters, and playful animations give it a lighthearted charm that appeals to both younger and older audiences.

## Pioneering PlayStation Classic
While the camera can occasionally be tricky and some levels demand patience, the innovative controls and inventive gameplay make up for these minor flaws. Ape Escape isn’t just a fun platformer, it’s a technical showcase and a pioneer in demonstrating how analog controls could redefine player interaction. Its combination of humor, challenge, and creativity ensures it remains a beloved classic in PlayStation’s library and a must-play for fans of inventive platforming.
