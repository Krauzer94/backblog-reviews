## Derivative First Hours
If you're someone who couldn't get past the first few hours of second entry to The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing franchise, you're not alone. Many people found the game's introduction to be a stumbling block. Gameplay-wise, the early hours introduced mechanics that felt derivative of other action RPGs, such as Diablo III. While the combat system was functional, it didn't offer enough innovation to captivate you into seeking a fresh experience.

## Slow, Uninspiring Start
The game's reliance on familiar tropes without adding unique twists may have contributed to the initial disengagement. Additionally, the game's pacing and progression system were slow to unfold. Without a compelling hook in the early stages. In summary, this game is presented a challenging start that may have deterred people from continuing. Its complex narrative introduction, derivative gameplay mechanics, and slow progression created an experience that didn't resonate with everyone from the outset.

## Personal Genre Fatigue
This is more of a personal gripe that I simply cannot enjoy these Diablo-like action RPGs anymore, so take this with a grain of salt. For me, the action RPG genre has gone past the "Diablo-like Era" and it is now living in the "Soulslike Era", and this is why I'm so harsh to these titles. But I can totally see somebody that still enjoy this approach to the genre, to have at least a good time with this one.
