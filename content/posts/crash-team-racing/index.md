## Skill-Based Kart Racing
CTR combines tight controls, creative track design, and a colorful cast of characters with power-ups and drift mechanics that reward skillful play, similar to previous kart titles of other franchises. Often compared to Mario Kart, CTR distinguishes itself with a robust Adventure Mode, where players can race through various tracks, collect relics, and face bosses in a light narrative, which was a selling point for me that was never really into kart titles before I found this one.

## Timeless Kart Classic
The power slide-boost mechanic adds depth and challenge, making races feel fast and satisfying, visually charming and mechanically sound, Crash Team Racing became a fan favorite and is still regarded as one of the best kart racers of its era. I highly recommend picking up the remake, unfortunately for me I don't have the platform it was released on, so I simply play the original, which is still a blast even for today's standards. This is definitely a must-play if you like the Crash Bandicoot franchise.
