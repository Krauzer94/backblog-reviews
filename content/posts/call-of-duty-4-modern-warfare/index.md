## Modern Warfare Redefined
This game marked a major turning point for the franchise, shifting from WWII to a modern combat setting, it's cinematic single-player campaign is gripping, with standout missions like "All Ghillied Up" delivering intense, immersive experiences, the story is well-paced, with memorable characters and emotional weight. The multiplayer revolutionized online shooters, though I admit that I didn't very much at the time, I started playing the multiplayer more "seriously" at MW2 and onward, so I missed out on this one quite a bit. While the graphics are dated by modern standards, the game remains a benchmark for first-person shooters, I consider this one of the best shooters of all time, I have a lot of it's scenes memorized forever because I played and replayed the campaign a lot of times, truly a groundbreaking classic that redefined the FPS genre.
