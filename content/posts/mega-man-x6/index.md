## Flawed Final Entry
The last PlayStation entry continues the fast-paced action-platforming of the X series but unfortunately stumbles in execution, while it retains solid core mechanics like tight controls and weapon variety, it's heavily criticized for poor level design, frustrating difficulty spikes, and unpolished localization. Some stages are unfairly punishing, with cluttered hazards and cheap enemy placement, and the rescue system for Reploids feels tedious, while the parts system is interesting, not all Reploids drop them so it is a game of guessing and not-so-fun grinding to collect them all. Not to mention the amount of points you need to salvage in order to be able to use more parts at the same time, which is even more tedious in comparison.

## Strong Music, Weak Farewell
The soundtrack is a standout with intense rock tracks, and fans may appreciate the continuation of the series' darker narrative, however, overall, X6 is considered one of the weaker entries in the franchise, best suited for diehard fans rather than newcomers. Myself included, this is my least favorite X title and the last one that I had on my backlog, a not so happy farewell, but I enjoyed it regardless, because even though it is the weakest Mega Man X title, it is still a very good video-game. I played using X at first, then a quick replay using Zero's Dark Hunter mode, which was a power fantasy blast that I love when Capcom decides to make these modes.
