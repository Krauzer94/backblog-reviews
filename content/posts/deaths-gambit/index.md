## Gothic Soulslike Identity
This game is a 2D action-RPG that mixes Soulslike combat with Metroidvania exploration. Its pixel art and gothic atmosphere are striking, creating a world that feels both haunting and beautiful. The story, centered on a pact with Death, adds to the moody tone and gives the game a distinct identity compared to its inspirations. And the main theme of this game is pretty much very well explored since dying is very easy on this title, and has some mechanics surrounding it.

## Risky Exploration and Bosses
The exploration is one of its strongest aspects, with interconnected areas, shortcuts, and secrets that reward curiosity. The unique death mechanic, where you lose healing plumes instead of currency, adds a refreshing risk, reward layer to progression. This also somewhat forces a more aggressive play-style compared to other games of the same sub-genre, not really an issue for me, but I can see some people not enjoying this. The boss fights also stand out for their design and scale, often feeling like highlights of the journey.

## Clunky Combat Execution
Unfortunately, the combat doesn’t always live up to the promise when it comes to it's execution, movement and attacks can feel sluggish and unresponsive, which makes encounters more frustrating than challenging. The stamina system is punishing in ways that discourage experimentation, and the more aggressive nature of this game is sometimes overwhelming, even more so than games like Bloodborne.

## Stylish Yet Flawed
While this title has plenty of ambition and undeniable style, its rough edges hold it back from greatness. For people who can forgive clunky controls and value atmosphere, world design, and mood above all else, it can still be a memorable adventure. Despite it's flaws I highly recommend this, it is one of the best Metroidvania Soulslikes that I've ever played, I consider it a must-play for fans of this sub-genre.
