## Strong Concept, Weak Hook
This title has an intriguing premise, mixing cyberpunk with magic in a noir-style world, but it didn’t quite hook me. The setting is cool and the writing is solid, but the gameplay felt a bit too slow and limited for my taste. The turn-based combat is functional but lacks depth early on, eve though I'm used and quite like this kind of combat style, and the linear structure left me feeling like my choices didn’t matter much. The interface also felt clunky, and the lack of manual saving was frustrating. Overall, it’s not a bad game, it just didn’t grab me enough to keep going past the first few hours.

## Moody Yet Static
As for its visuals, it has a distinct and moody style that fits the Shadowrun universe well, even if it’s fairly minimalistic. The isometric perspective and static environments do a good job of conveying atmosphere, but they also make the world feel a bit rigid and lifeless at times. Sound design and music are serviceable and occasionally atmospheric, yet they rarely stand out or elevate key moments in the story.

## Faithful but Shallow
I can see why this title resonates with fans of the tabletop RPG or players deeply invested in its lore, as it faithfully captures the tone and themes of the universe. Still, as a standalone experience, it feels more like a foundation than a fully realized game. With more tactical depth and better pacing, it could have been something special, but as it stands, it left me appreciating the idea more than the execution.
