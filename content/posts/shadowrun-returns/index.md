## Strong Concept, Weak Hook
This title has an intriguing premise, mixing cyberpunk with magic in a noir-style world, but it didn’t quite hook me. The setting is cool and the writing is solid, but the gameplay felt a bit too slow and limited for my taste. The turn-based combat is functional but lacks depth early on, eve though I'm used and quite like this kind of combat style, and the linear structure left me feeling like my choices didn’t matter much. The interface also felt clunky, and the lack of manual saving was frustrating. Overall, it’s not a bad game, it just didn’t grab me enough to keep going past the first few hours.
