This title is a charming platformer that captures the Disney magic with bright, colorful graphics and smooth animations. You can control Mickey or Minnie as they navigate six imaginative levels, each filled with whimsical obstacles and enemies. The game shines with its costume system, which grants different abilities such as climbing walls, vacuuming up enemies, or using a gun, adding variety and light strategy to the gameplay.

Cooperative two-player mode is a notable highlight, allowing friends or family to enjoy the adventure together. However, the game is relatively short and easy, making it better suited for younger audiences or those looking for a casual experience. Some level designs feel repetitive, and while the costumes are fun, certain outfits can feel awkward or underutilized.

Overall, this game is a well-crafted, visually appealing platformer that is enjoyable for Disney fans. It offers a lighthearted and accessible experience but lacks the depth and challenge that more seasoned platformer enthusiasts might seek. I consider this one of the best SNES titles, along with all the other Disney ones it had, they are very good experiences, despite being very simplistic in general.
