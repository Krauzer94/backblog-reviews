## Bold Multiplayer Experiment
This title was Capcom’s bold attempt to bring the classic Resident Evil survival horror formula into the world of online multiplayer, a concept far ahead of its time. Instead of playing as a trained special agent, you took on the roles of everyday citizens trapped in the chaos of Raccoon City. Each character had unique abilities and items, encouraging teamwork and strategic cooperation across several self-contained scenarios. The game retained the familiar elements of the series, fixed camera angles, limited inventory space, scarce resources, and deliberate tank controls, but reimagined them for a cooperative experience.

## Teamwork Under Pressure
When played online, communication and coordination were essential, as the group had to solve puzzles, share items, and fight to stay alive amid the spreading T-virus. Offline, AI companions filled in for human players, though their sluggish responsiveness often frustrated solo players. If you are interested in the online experience, at least up until the moment I'm writing this, the community still seems to be active and have developed a way to bring back the online multiplayer feature.

## Ambitious Yet Limited
There are community servers which you can connect to and play the emulated version of the game after you go through some hacking to set things up properly. Technically, Outbreak was ambitious but hampered by the limitations of early 2000s online infrastructure. Slow load times, clunky menus, and limited communication options (restricted to preset phrases) made teamwork cumbersome. Yet despite its flaws, the game exuded atmosphere, with detailed environments, tense pacing, and a grim tone that captured the panic and hopelessness of Raccoon City better than many entries in the series.

## Cult Classic Legacy
While not a mainstream hit at release, this gmae has since gained a devoted cult following. Fans continue to appreciate its creativity, sense of community, and survival horror authenticity, elements that laid the groundwork for future multiplayer experiments in the Resident Evil franchise. This was one of my favorite games of the PlayStation 2 simply because of it's unique experience, not because of the multiplayer, but because of the amount of different outcomes each level had to offer. This is a very limited mechanic compared to the second entry, but it is still there since you can experience the levels very differently depending on the character that you choose on playing.
