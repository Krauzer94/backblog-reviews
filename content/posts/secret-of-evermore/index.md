## Quirky Action RPG
This title is an action RPG that is notable for being the only Square RPG made exclusively by the U.S. team, it shares gameplay similarities with Secret of Mana, featuring real-time combat, a charge-based attack system, and ring menus, even the animations, menus and sound effects were recycled, though this is not a bad thing since they are very unique and high quality. You play as a boy and his shapeshifting dog, journeying through imaginative worlds based on B-movie tropes, from prehistoric lands to futuristic cities. I remember being blown away at the first time I saw this title because I couldn't believe that the dog companion could, not just shapeshift, but also have it's own AI and actions, a very unique mechanic at the time.

## Alchemy-Driven Adventure
The alchemy-based magic system adds a unique twist, requiring players to mix ingredients rather than use traditional MP-based spells, giving an unique layer of complexity to the combat, specially in some very challenging enemy encounters, or even for some of the repetitive sections. While it lacks the multiplayer of Secret of Mana and can feel grindy, Secret of Evermore stands out for its quirky humor, atmospheric soundtrack, and strong sense of adventure. It's a cult classic for the SNES platform, though not without flaws like uneven pacing and some clunky mechanics, best enjoyed with patience and a taste for 90s oddball storytelling.
