## Episodic Survival Experiment
The second entry for the Resident Evil: Revelations sub-franchise, it marked an interesting experiment for the franchise with its episodic format. The MCs are Claire Redfield and Barry Burton, offering tense scenarios and a mix of action and survival-horror elements. The character-switching mechanic adds variety, especially when paired with local co-op, making the experience more dynamic and engaging. And while this is not something new when it comes to Capcom titles, it is brilliantly implemented here, which is also nice when paired with the episodic format, somewhat similar to the first Alan Wake title.

## Atmosphere and Replay Value
Some people at the time praised the game’s atmosphere, the interplay between characters, and the addictive Raid Mode, which provided strong replay value. Though I admit that I didn't quite explored these gameplay formats, I just enjoyed the main story and then I was done with the game. The episodic cliffhangers kept the narrative engaging, and the pacing, while uneven at times, often delivered satisfying bursts of tension.

## Technical and Design Flaws
On the downside, visuals were considered underwhelming compared to other titles from the same era, with weak textures and limited detail. And in my opinion this is totally understandable since this was originally meant for the PlayStation Vita platform. The absence of online co-op in the story campaign disappointed many people, and some episodes felt padded or repetitive.

## Divisive Yet Worthwhile
Over time, fans have remained divided. Many still appreciate its darker tone, character dynamics, and the return of Barry Burton, while others view it as one of the weaker entries due to its technical limitations and uneven execution. Particularly I liked both character gameplay styles, I got no complains on this regard, while at the same time, I was forever interested in playing as Barry since the very first RE title. Overall, it stands as a solid but imperfect Resident Evil title, worth playing for its story and cooperative gameplay, though it is not a must-play for survival horror fans, but it is one if you are a fan of the RE franchise to any extent.
