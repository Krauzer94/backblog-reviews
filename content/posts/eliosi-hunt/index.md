## Game Overview
This title is a Brazilian indie action game, developed with Unreal Engine 4. It combines twin-stick shooting with platforming in a sci-fi setting, where you control Eliosi, a young alien aspiring to become a bounty hunter. The game offers five main stages with distinct environments, bosses, and collectibles, and it encourages replayability through speedrunning challenges, hidden items, and branching paths.

## Visuals and Challenge
The strongest points are its visuals and atmosphere, which feel polished and ambitious for a debut indie title. Environments look alien and varied, with good lighting and effects. The game also provides a high level of challenge that can be rewarding who enjoy precise movement and tough encounters. Its design encourages mastery, with mechanics like destroying checkpoints for faster runs adding depth.

## Difficulty and Length Issues
On the downside, the difficulty can feel punishing, often due to imprecise platforming, confusing visuals, or overwhelming enemy encounters. Some boss fights and sections come across as unfair rather than just hard. The campaign is short, with only five levels, so while there is replay value, so if you are looking for a longer experience the you may find it limited.

## Final Verdict
Overall, this is is a visually appealing game, ambitious, and tough action platformer that will appeal most to fans of old-school, skill-based games who don’t mind frequent retries. For people who prefer a smoother difficulty curve or a longer narrative experience, it may be frustrating or feel too brief. I consider this a very mid game, and I don't recommend trying it out, it is a very disposable title.
