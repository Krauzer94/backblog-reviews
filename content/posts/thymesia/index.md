## Fast Aggressive Combat
This title is a compact Souls-like action RPG that emphasizes fast, aggressive combat with mechanics centered around dodges, deflects, and plague weapon abilities. Its combat system is tight and rewarding, encouraging people to master precision and timing in fights. Particularly speaking the style this game enforces on players is exactly the way I've forever played the Souls-like titles, so this was not a first for me, quite the opposite, this game felt natural to my way of approaching these titles.

## Limited Depth Appeal
But I can totally see somebody that plays a totally different way to dislike this one, since it doesn't really have the same amount of depth and complexity of a traditional Souls-like RPG, so not a big amount of builds and ways to play this. The dark, plague-ravaged world it presents is atmospheric, with strong art direction and some striking level and boss designs.

## Repetitive Rough Edges
Despite its strengths in combat, the game struggles with repetition and limited variety. Enemy types and environments often feel recycled, and the story is vague and underdeveloped, leaving little narrative depth to explore. Technical roughness, from occasional performance issues to imprecise hit detection, can also dampen the experience, especially in a genre that relies heavily on precision.

## Focused Soulslike Experience
Overall, this game offers a solid, fast-paced alternative for fans of Souls-likes who want a shorter and more focused challenge. While it lacks the polish and variety of its inspirations, it delivers enough intensity and atmosphere to make it a worthwhile experience for people who can overlook its shortcomings. I consider this a must-play if you enjoy Souls-likes, while at the same time, your playstyle is somewhat similar to what this videogame is trying to promote.
