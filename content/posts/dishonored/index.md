## Stylish Stealth Revenge
This game is a stylish first-person action-stealth game developed by Arkane Studios. set in the plague-ridden, steampunk-inspired city of Dunwall, the MC is called Corvo Attano, a bodyguard framed for murder who gains supernatural powers to exact revenge or deliver justice. The game's standout features are its immersive world-building, flexible gameplay, and moral choice system, which at the time was nothing groundbreaking but the standout here is that it was amazingly implemented.

## Freedom Over Complexity
You can tackle missions with brutal force, stealth, or clever use of powers like teleportation and time-freezing. Each choice impacts the story and world, encouraging replayability, though out of all Dishonored titles, this is the least complex one when it comes to this mechanic. Though the combat can feel clunky at times and the story is straightforward, Dishonored shines with its freedom of approach, art design, and atmosphere. This is definitely a must-play for fans of immersive sims and stealth.
