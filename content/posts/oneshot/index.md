## Surreal Meta Journey
This title is a surreal puzzle-adventure game that blends exploration, clever puzzles, and emotional storytelling into a unique experience. The MC is called Niko, a cat-like child, through a strange, dying world in an effort to restore its “sun,” a fragile lightbulb, all while the game breaks the fourth wall and treats you, the player, as an active character in the story. It shares some similarities with Undertale, especially when it comes to breaking the 4th wall, and also the obvious art-style which uses simply pixelated 2D designs.

## Intimate Meta Storytelling
Its meta-narrative is its greatest strength, using your computer’s desktop and files as part of the gameplay to create a rare sense of intimacy and immersion. The world is haunting yet charming, filled with subtle details and a quiet melancholy that deepens your connection to Niko. While the visuals are simple and some puzzles can feel obscure, the heartfelt writing and innovative presentation make it a standout indie title.

## Unforgettable Indie Experience
This one is truly one of the most unique titles I've ever played, it'll for sure stick on your mind forever if you play it with no spoilers like I did, this is a must-play for fans of puzzle games in general. Short but impactful, OneShot leaves a lasting impression long after the credits roll, especially if you enjoy games that challenge the boundaries between fiction and reality.
