## Retro Cyber-Ninja Style
This title is a 2D action-platformer developed by JoyMasher, the studio behind Blazing Chrome, I'll forever recommend this company, it has amazing titles, not to mention it is from my homeland. It’s a deliberate throwback to the 16-bit era, evoking classics like Mega Man X, Strider, and Shinobi. The MC is a cybernetic ninja who turns against its creators and fights through a series of themed stages filled with enemies, traps, and bosses. The game’s presentation nails its retro inspirations, with sharp pixel art, fluid animations, and an energetic synth soundtrack that perfectly captures the mood of a dystopian, futuristic rebellion.

## Tight, Engaging Gameplay
Gameplay is tight and responsive, emphasizing precise movement, well-timed attacks, and pattern recognition. Each boss you defeat grants new abilities, while collectible “modifier chips” let you tweak your playstyle, adding a touch of modern customization. Though don't expect a high level of depth, it is just enough to make this interesting and engaging beyond mindlessly going forward, but it is nice to have, it is a nice and needed addition to the simplistic formula of these kinds of games. The difficulty curve is fair, challenging but rarely frustrating, offering just enough resistance to keep you engaged without slipping into unfair territory.

## Short but Satisfying
The main downside is the game’s short duration, with only a handful of stages, most people can finish it in a few hours, and there isn’t much incentive to replay beyond experimenting with upgrades or chasing higher ranks. While its mechanics are solid, this game doesn’t do much to innovate beyond its influences, which makes it feel more like a tribute than a reinvention, and this is not necessarily a bad thing if the execution is high quality, which is the case for this title. Still, for fans of retro action games, it’s a stylish, fast-paced, and satisfying experience that delivers exactly what it promises.
