## Predatory Survival Horror
The game delivers intense tension with limited resources, atmospheric sound design, with a good balance between graphical and psychological horror, and smart enemy AI that makes dinosaurs more unpredictable than typical horror foes. Its real-time 3D environments (unlike Resident Evil’s pre-rendered backgrounds) were groundbreaking for the time and enhanced immersion. While the puzzles (some are very hard) and backtracking may feel dated now, the game remains a unique, action-packed survival horror experience. It’s a must-play for fans of classic PS1 horror games.
