## High-Speed Blade Combat
This game trades Metal Gear’s traditional stealth gameplay for high-speed, over-the-top action. The MC now is the legendary Raiden, a cybernetically enhanced ninja armed with a katana and the game’s signature “Blade Mode,” which allows you to slow time and precisely slice through enemies and objects. And while we had seen this character in the mainline series before, you could never play as him, so this was a very different and unique approach, and even though it divided fans at the time, I enjoyed this one a lot even though I'm a big fan of the MGS franchise.

## Over-the-Top Spectacle
The combat is flashy, responsive, and bolstered by a bombastic soundtrack and some of the most memorable boss fights in the action genre, even though this is the first time this franchise had an entry like this. The story is deliberately over-the-top, leaning heavily into camp and political satire, but it lacks the depth and complexity of the mainline Metal Gear series. The campaign is short, often taking less than eight hours to complete, though its pacing is tight and the boss encounters make up for the brevity. Replay value comes mainly from higher difficulty modes and the satisfaction of mastering the parry system.

## Stylish Yet Flawed Port
On PC, the game suffers from some technical shortcomings. The camera can be frustrating, the controls feel clunky without a controller, and the port has resolution and frame-rate quirks. Despite these flaws, the core gameplay remains exciting, and with a gamepad, it offers a thrilling, stylish action experience. For those who value spectacle and fast-paced combat over stealth and deep storytelling, it’s a sharp and satisfying ride, I'd say this is a must for fans of Hack'N Slash titles such as Devil May Cry. This one also inspired a lot of memes going around even to this day, since it's characters are very charismatic and exaggerated, it is worth playing solely because of this.
