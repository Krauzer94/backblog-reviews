## Storybook RPG Foundations
The title is a visually stunning RPG that feels like a living storybook, its hand-painted, watercolor-inspired environments and delicate musical score create a magical, fairy-tale atmosphere. The gameplay combines 2D platforming with a turn-based combat system that emphasizes timing and strategy. The MC is called Aurora and her companion Igniculus, using tactical moves and elemental attacks to overcome enemies.

## Poetic but Simple Depth
The story unfolds entirely in rhymed verse, giving it a poetic and whimsical tone, and while some people find this charming, others feel the rhymes can be forced, slightly affecting immersion. Although relatively short, around 10~12 hours, it offers meaningful customization through abilities and elemental strategies. But don't expect a very complex RPG, or even a party-RPG level, of depth, it is a somewhat simpler experience compared to other titles, leaning toward something like Sea of Stars and Mario RPG, for example.

## Charming, Concise Journey
A lot of people praised its art direction, music, and inventive combat, while noting its brevity and occasionally simplistic systems. Overall, Child of Light is a memorable and emotionally engaging experience, celebrated for its beauty, charm, and unique storytelling, even if it is concise. There is no excuse not to play this if you like simpler RPGs such as the ones that I already mentioned, but if you like complex systems than skip this one. I admit that I played this solely because of the art-style, but since I love less complex systems, and turn-based combat, this also helped me stick to finishing this title.
