## Atmospheric Sci-Fi Horror
This title is an immersive sim that combines science fiction, horror, and exploration into one of the most atmospheric experiences of its era. Set aboard Talos I, a massive space station orbiting the Moon, the MC is called Morgan Yu, a scientist who wakes up in a world that quickly unravels into chaos. The once-bustling research facility has been overrun by the Typhon, a shape-shifting alien species capable of mimicking everyday objects. From the moment you step into the station, Prey captures you with its unsettling mood, smart level design, and an overarching sense of isolation and mystery.

## Talos I World-Building
Talos I itself is the true star of the game. Every section of the station feels distinct, from luxurious corporate offices to claustrophobic maintenance tunnels, and everything is connected in a way that rewards backtracking and exploration. Arkane’s trademark world-building shines here, as even minor details, emails, audio logs, and environmental clues, flesh out the lives of the crew and the tragedy that befell them. There’s an impressive freedom in how you can navigate and interact with the world, whether you choose to hack locked doors, use alien abilities to transform into small objects, or simply find alternate physical routes using your tools.

## Flexible Gameplay Builds
The gameplay systems encourage experimentation and creativity, you can build your character with human skills like engineering and hacking or embrace alien powers such as telekinesis and mimicry. And this system is complex enough to lock you in a certain "build", you cannot make yourself overpowered by leveling up each and every ability, instead you need to choose a playstyle and stick to it in order to it effective enough to be worth it. Each choice affects how you approach challenges and how other characters perceive you.

## Ingenious Tools & Design
The GLOO Cannon, a versatile tool that can freeze enemies or create climbable platforms, is emblematic of Prey’s ingenuity, nearly every item in the game can serve multiple purposes depending on your imagination. This is by far the most useful weapon you'll be using, I used this quite a lot, from the start, to the very end of the game, it never stops being useful, especially to clean out weaker enemies, and there is a whole lot of them. Visually, it is striking without relying on photorealism. The soundtrack enhances the tension perfectly, mixing eerie ambient sounds with sudden bursts of energy during combat.

## Uneven but Engaging Combat
Despite its strengths, Prey has a few shortcomings, the combat, while serviceable, often feels clunky and less polished than the exploration or puzzle-solving aspects. Early encounters with Mimics can be tense and terrifying, but later battles sometimes drag due to repetitive enemy types and resource scarcity. The pacing can also slow down in the middle portion, where objectives become less urgent and the story loses some of its early momentum. While the ending offers interesting twists, it feels somewhat abrupt compared to the depth of the journey that precedes it.

## Underappreciated Immersive Sim
Ultimately, this game stands as one of the most underappreciated sci-fi games of the last decade. It challenges the you to think, explore, and experiment rather than simply shoot their way through. With its layered storytelling, immersive environments, and deep mechanics, it captures the spirit of classic immersive sims like System Shock and Deus Ex while carving out its own identity. Prey may not be flawless, but it’s a rich and rewarding experience that continues to resonate with those who appreciate atmosphere, freedom, and thoughtful design in their games. This is truly one of the best immersive sims we got up until now, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.
