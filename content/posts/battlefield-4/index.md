## Destruction-Fueled Warfare
This title delivers a high-octane military shooter experience with large-scale battles, destructible environments, and intense multiplayer warfare, similar to the previous entry, improving in almost every aspect of it. The Frostbite 3 engine powers impressive visuals and dynamic elements like collapsing skyscrapers and flooding streets. Expanding upon the most praised mechanic of the same engine, with even more impressive elements that could be destroyed, such as entire buildings.

## Multiplayer Over Campaign
While the single-player campaign is forgettable and riddled with clichés, the real strength lies in its 64-player multiplayer, featuring diverse maps, vehicles, and tactical depth, this time, focusing more on infantry combat than vehicle warfare. Though since the servers were very flexible, you could always find games focused on one or the other, but the general common feeling is that the map design had infantry in mind, or even aerial and aquatic vehicle combat, compared to Battlefield 3 which focused more on ground warfare.

## Rough Launch, Redeemed
At launch, the game was plagued with bugs and stability issues, but post-release patches and community support significantly improved performance and gameplay over time. And unfortunately this title also uses a browser-based lobby, so no in-game way to search for matches, servers and etc, which is a big downside in my opinion since the website's UX/UI was terrible. This is great for fans of chaotic, team-based warfare. Still holds up for multiplayer fun, especially with friends.
