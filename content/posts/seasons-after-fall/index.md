## Charming Visuals and Atmosphere
This title is a charming puzzle-platformer that stands out for its hand-painted, storybook-like visuals. The world feels alive, with seasonal changes that directly affect the environment, giving puzzles a satisfying depth without overwhelming the player. The game’s soundtrack and ambient sounds enhance its fairy-tale atmosphere, making exploration a calm, immersive experience.

## Clever Seasonal Puzzle Mechanics
One of it's standouts is switching between the four seasons to solve environmental puzzles is intuitive and often clever, keeping gameplay engaging. However, the game is relatively short, typically lasting 4~6 hours, and some puzzles involve repetitive backtracking. Particularly speaking I don't really mind this since this is really what this game is trying to do, being a short and beautiful puzzle platformer, with unique and alternative narrative elements, and it shines when delivering all this.

## Navigation and Puzzle Clarity
But there are some drawbacks, it can be unclear where to go next, which amounts to the puzzle complexity. Instead, it should have a clear sing-posting of what to do next, in order for the player to focus solely in the platforming and puzzle-solving. Overall, this game is best enjoyed by people who appreciate beautiful visuals, relaxing exploration, and gentle puzzles rather than challenging or lengthy gameplay. It’s a peaceful, atmospheric experience that emphasizes mood and discovery over complexity.
