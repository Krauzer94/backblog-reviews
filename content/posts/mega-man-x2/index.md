## Refined X Formula
This one is a strong sequel that builds on the foundation of the original Mega Man X, it refines the fast-paced platforming and action gameplay with tighter controls, new weapons, and more varied level designs, you can't go wrong by just adding more to the already successful formula at the time. The introduction of the X-Hunters adds a layer of challenge and narrative depth and replayability, which was tried to improve even further in future sequels, but started o this one, while the inclusion of the Cx4 chip enables impressive wireframe effects for the time.

## 16-Bit X Excellence
While it doesn't reinvent the formula, X2 delivers excellent 16-bit action, rewarding exploration, and smooth difficulty progression. It's a must-play for fans of the series and a standout in the SNES library. I has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history, similar to the first X title, though not as good because it is a very hard, maybe even impossible, task to achieve this, anyway this is a must play for the SNES platform.
