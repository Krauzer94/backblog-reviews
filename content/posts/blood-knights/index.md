## Uninspired Vampire Narrative
This title is a hack-and-slash action RPG that combines vampire lore with fast-paced combat and cooperative gameplay. The MCs are Jeremy, a vampire hunter turned into what he despises, and Alysa, a vampire warrior forced to fight alongside him. Their uneasy alliance drives the narrative, though the plot and dialogue are often criticized for being predictable and lacking depth. The characters are not very charismatic, this is one of the biggest downsides in my opinion, because there are a lot of dialogs on this game.

## Repetitive Co-op Combat
The gameplay centers on melee and ranged combat, with Jeremy wielding swords and Alysa using crossbows. You can switch between the two characters or play in local co-op, which adds variety. However, the combat tends to feel repetitive, with limited enemy types and simplistic mechanics that don’t evolve much as the game progresses. I really tried to like this one but I couldn't bring myself to beat it, it is not very balanced for playing alone, which is how I choose to go, so my advise is to only try this one out if you have a friend to join in.

## Rough Budget Experience
Visually, this game shows its budget, with dated graphics and stiff animations, though its gothic-inspired environments still carry some atmosphere. The game also suffers from technical rough edges, including awkward controls and occasional bugs. I don't really recommend this one, it is not a good experience, either alone or accompanies with a friend in coop mode.
