## A Masterpiece of Art
This title is one of those rare games that manages to be both a thrilling action experience and a profound work of art. Developed under the eccentric and visionary direction of Yoko Taro, it combines stylish, high-speed combat with a layered narrative that explores what it means to be human, through the eyes of androids and machines long after humanity has vanished. I knew this was one of the highly praised titles of all time, but I thought this was because of how exotic it was, not to mention it was part of a franchise which I had never heard of. But after playing this and experiencing almost all of it's contents, I can safely say this is absolutely one of the best games of all time.

## A Story Beyond War
Set thousands of years in the future, the story follows combat androids 2B, 9S, and later A2, as they fight to reclaim Earth from alien-created machines. What begins as a seemingly straightforward war between androids and robots slowly unravels into a philosophical and emotional journey filled with existential questions, moral ambiguity, and heartbreak. And for me this is where this game shines, I think it's biggest strength is it's story and the meaning behind it. And I'm not talking about some cliche vangeance plot, or some convoluted story with a lot of plot-twists, this is genuinely one of the best stories you can find on modern videogames.

## Routes, Endings, Gameplay
Each of the game’s multiple main routes (A through E) reveals new perspectives and hidden truths, turning the act of replaying into a vital part of the storytelling rather than simple repetition. The game also has a ton of secret endings, which are mostly meme endings, you'll for sure experience some of them without even knowing. The combat is fast, fluid, and satisfying, allowing you to chain together sword slashes, ranged attacks, and acrobatics with ease. It also constantly experiments with gameplay perspective, shifting from 3D hack-and-slash to 2D platforming or even top-down bullet-hell segments, often within the same mission.

## World and Atmosphere
These transitions feel seamless and serve both mechanical and narrative purposes, keeping you constantly engaged. Visually, the game embraces a desolate beauty, ruined cities overrun by nature, hauntingly empty deserts, and broken amusement parks filled with lifeless machines that somehow evoke emotion. The minimalist art direction is elevated by an extraordinary OST, whose music shifts between ethereal vocals and driving battle themes, perfectly capturing the game’s emotional tone.

## Emotional, Philosophical Impact
Where this game truly stands out is in its willingness to challenge you emotionally and intellectually. It questions purpose, consciousness, and the nature of life itself, all through the lens of characters who are, ironically, not human. The final hours, and especially the ending sequence, are among the most memorable and impactful in gaming history. This game is a rare masterpiece that transcends genres. It’s not just a game you play, it’s one you feel, think about, and remember long after the credits roll. This is absolutely a must-play if you like action games, or if you agree with the idea that videogames are a work of art, to any degree.
