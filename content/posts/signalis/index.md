## Retro Horror Excellence
This title is an indie survival horror game developed by the two-person German studio rose-engine. It skillfully blends retro aesthetics with modern storytelling, evoking the classic survival horror titles of the late '90s and early 2000s, drawing comparisons to Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The MS is called Elster, a combat-trained android searching for her missing partner, Ariane, on a desolate planet. The story unfolds in a fragmented, dreamlike way, exploring themes of identity, memory, and existential dread. Its psychological depth and emotional resonance have been widely praised, I dare to say it has the same level of quality as big franchises such as Silent Hill.

## Tense Strategic Gameplay
Gameplay features a top-down 2.5D perspective with fixed camera angles, limited inventory management, and intricate puzzles. Combat is deliberate and resource-constrained, heightening tension and requiring strategic thinking. While some aspects, like aiming and boss fight design, have minor flaws, they do not significantly impact the overall experience. In fact, I think the somewhat clunky nature of them are actually a feature, since it makes everything much more realistic when it comes to the protagonist mental state while dealing with the nightmarish situation she is in.

## PS1-Style Atmosphere
Visually, Signalis draws inspiration from early PlayStation-era games, with a distinctive art style complemented by a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack that enhances immersion. The game received generally favorable reviews, earning praise for its atmosphere and environmental storytelling. It was included in Polygon's list of the best games of 2022 and recognized as the best horror game of 2022 by several outlets. A standout for me is the level of replayability, which is not something new to the frachise, but the way this was implemented into the game's narrative is one of the most creative things I've ever experienced in any game.

## A Must-Play Horror
I highly encourage trying to 100% this game, since this feels like the intended way of playing it, not just because of the challenge and the completionist status, but mainly because of it's story. You'll only get to experience everything it is trying to convey if you dig deep into the alternative endings and optional content, and it'll be a blast of an experience. Overall, Signalis is highly recommended for fans of psychological and retro survival horror, offering a compelling narrative, immersive design, and thoughtful gameplay that make it a standout experience. This is definitely one of the best survival horror games of all time, and a must-play if you like this genre to any extent.
