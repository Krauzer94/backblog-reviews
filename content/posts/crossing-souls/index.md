## Nostalgic Coming-of-Age
This title is an indie action-adventure game developed by Fourattic and published by Devolver Digital, one of my favorite publishers. It tells the story of a group of kids in 1980s California who stumble upon a mysterious device that allows them to interact with the world of the dead. The game leans heavily on nostalgic influences like The Goonies and Stranger Things, blending retro homages with a coming-of-age adventure, and was the selling point for me, but I stayed because of the amazing story, gameplay and especially, the characters.

## Stellar Retro Presentation
Visually, it shines with colorful 16-bit pixel art and VHS-style animated cutscenes that capture the spirit of the era. Its synth-driven soundtrack is equally strong, delivering an authentic retro feel that keeps the atmosphere engaging. The presentation is undoubtedly its greatest strength, if you are a fan of pixel-art than this game is one of the best you can find, the animations and art is incredible.

## Charming but Shallow Story
Gameplay mixes beat ’em up combat, light puzzles, platforming, and boss fights, each of the five playable characters has unique abilities, and switching between them is essential for progress. The story is heartfelt and full of ‘80s charm, and while the writing and character development often lack depth, it makes up for how charismatic the cast is. While the premise is intriguing, the dialogue leans on stereotypes, and emotional beats don’t always land, still, the adventure carries enough energy and sincerity to keep you invested.

## Stylish Yet Rough
Overall, Crossing Souls is a vibrant tribute to 1980s pop culture, it captures the look, sound, and atmosphere of its inspirations but struggles with gameplay polish and narrative weight. For people seeking a nostalgic journey wrapped in style, it’s a worthwhile experience, though one that asks for patience with its rougher edges. I would only recommend this if you are very into retro games, or have nostalgia for the 80's, otherwise this is a skippable title with a good cast.
