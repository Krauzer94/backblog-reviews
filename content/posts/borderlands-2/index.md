## Didn’t Quite Click
I gave Borderlands 2 a couple of hours, hoping to get hooked, but it just didn’t click with me, I don't even know why I gave this one a chance if I didn't really liked the first title. The art style is striking, the humor is sharp, and the gunplay feels tight and varied, yet I never found myself fully engaged. The constant stream of loot and quirky characters clearly has a lot of charm, but it didn’t pull me in the way it seems to for so many others.

## Not My Experience
It’s easy to see why the game has such a dedicated fanbase, there’s a lot of creativity and polish here. The world is vibrant, the writing has personality, and the co-op focus is a big draw for the right crowd. Still, despite recognizing its quality, it just isn’t my kind of experience. Some games you admire from a distance, and for me, Borderlands 2 falls into that category. I really wanted to like this one but it is simply too repetitive for my taste, and I was not willing to give the coop a chance, my guess is that it is more bearable if played with others.

## Slow Burn Progression
On a more mechanical level, the RPG systems and progression also felt like they demanded a longer commitment than I was willing to give. Skills unlock slowly, and early encounters are meshed together, making the opening hours feel like a prolonged warm-up rather than a strong hook. And I'm particularly against this approach, even though I enjoy Soulslike games very much, and they like to implement this kind of introduction. Enemy encounters often devolve into shooting galleries with familiar patterns, and while the variety of weapons is impressive on paper, most drops quickly became interchangeable noise instead of exciting rewards.

## Respect, Not Love
In the end, it strikes me as a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and executes that vision confidently, just not in a way that aligns with my preferences. I can appreciate its identity, humor, and the joy it clearly brings to its audience, especially as a shared experience. But as a mostly solo, repetition-averse player, it left me more fatigued than entertained. Sometimes a game can be good, even great, and still not be for you, and this title is a clear example of that for me.
