## Charismatic New Protagonist
This game is a standalone expansion to the original Crysis, where now you play as Sergeant "Psycho" Sykes during the same timeline as the first game, and this seems like not a big deal, but I really like this character over the first one's MC, it is miles ahead more likable and charismatic. I got to admit that the MC alone carries this game, at least for me, and this is more due to the Prophet being a very plain character to begin with. My guess is that they focused heavily in the technical aspects of the game, such as the graphics, and while the story is not all that bad, the characters were lacking.

## Focused Action Experience
It delivers a more focused, fast-paced, and action-heavy experience, trimming down on the open-world elements for tighter, cinematic missions, this is one hell of a ride compared to the base game, way more action-packed, and I love it, while at the same time, I'm also a fan of a more stealth/tactical approach. The gameplay retains the iconic Nanosuit mechanics, offering multiple tactical approaches, while the graphics, even by modern standards, remain visually stunning. However, the campaign is relatively short and less ambitious in scope, overall, it's a polished and explosive companion piece that complements the original well.
