## Distinctive Setting and Hero
This AC entry is an enhanced port of the original PlayStation Vita title, the MC is called Aveline de Grandpré, a rare female lead in the series and one of its most distinctive protagonists. It is set in 18th-century New Orleans, the surrounding bayous, and Mayan ruins. The game introduces a unique “persona system,” letting Aveline disguise herself as an Assassin, a Lady, or a Slave, each with distinct abilities and limitations. This mechanic, along with the vibrant historical setting, gives Liberation a unique flavor compared to the mainline Assassin’s Creed entries.

## Short, Uneven Campaign
The campaign is notably shorter, clocking in at around 8~10 hours, and the narrative, while intriguing, can feel rushed and occasionally confusing due to abrupt transitions and limited exposition. Mission variety is limited, with several repetitive tailing or eavesdropping tasks, and the AI often behaves inconsistently, swinging between overly alert and strangely oblivious. Though this is expected since this was originally released for a handheld, which has simpler and shorter titles compared to regular consoles.

## For Hardcore Fans
Combat is serviceable but basic, relying heavily on counter-kill mechanics familiar from earlier games, so no news on this regard, it is the good old AC classic combat. While the visuals are sharper than the Vita version, they don’t match the scale or polish of other Assassin’s Creed titles from the same era. Despite these flaws, many fans appreciate Liberation HD for its fresh perspective, focused scope, and Aveline’s engaging character, I would only recommend this one for hardcore AC fans, otherwise, it is a skippable title.
