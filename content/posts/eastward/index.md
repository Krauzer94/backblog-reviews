## Retro Charm Reimagined
This game is a beautifully crafted indie RPG which combines retro pixel art with modern design sensibilities, drawing inspiration from classics like The Legend of Zelda and EarthBound, as well as the whimsical storytelling of Studio Ghibli films. And if you are not already sold on this title by this point, I don't think the rest of it's elements will, because even though this is a high quality title, these elements are still it's biggest standouts.

## A World Worth Exploring
Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has retreated underground, the MCs are called John, a miner, and Sam, a mysterious girl with special abilities, as they journey to the surface. The game excels at world-building, presenting decaying towns, vibrant characters, and atmospheric environments that feel alive and lived-in. I can't praise this game's visuals enough, it is definitely what made me want to play it in the first place, but I stayed and finished it because of it's characters and story.

## Emotional Journey, Flawed Combat
The visuals are striking, with detailed pixel art that brings each location to life, while the narrative balances lighthearted charm with emotional depth. John and Sam's evolving relationship adds a strong emotional core, making the adventure engaging and memorable. Though the pacing can feel slow at times, with long dialogues that occasionally disrupt the flow. Combat is serviceable but repetitive, and certain plot points remain unresolved, leaving some narrative threads ambiguous.

## A Unique Indie Gem
Overall, Eastward is a heartfelt and atmospheric RPG that successfully blends nostalgia with innovation. It’s highly recommended for fans of story-driven adventures and players who appreciate rich, pixel-art worlds. It is definitely one of the most unique games that I've ever played, despite it's gameplay not being the most original out there. Another amazing feature it has, is a in-game meta-game, which is similar to something like the classic Final Fantasy titles, totally optional but still worth playing, which you can invest a couple of hours in if you want the whole experience.
