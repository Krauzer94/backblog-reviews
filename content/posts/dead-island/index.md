## Strong Start, Weak Progression
This game is a first-person action RPG set on a tropical island overrun by zombies. The game mixes melee combat, exploration, and light RPG elements like leveling and weapon crafting, and while this may look interesting, it is not a big appeal to me, so I admit that the core mechanics of this game start off very interesting, but I quickly get tired of it. Weapons break way too easy and the progress system is too slow to follow the combat complexity and difficulty spikes.

## Designed for Co-op
Its open-world environment and co-op mode offer fun and chaotic moments, especially when played with friends. However, it's held back by technical issues, inconsistent tone, repetitive missions, and clunky combat. Despite its flaws, it found a niche audience and became a cult favorite for fans of zombie survival games. I admit that I didn't played this one up until the credits roll because it was simply not that interesting to me, maybe because I played the whole thing solo, so my advise is to play this in co-op mode.

## Uneven Storytelling
As for its narrative, it struggles to maintain momentum, the introduction is intriguing, and the opening hours suggest a more serious, survival-focused story, but the writing and character development rarely live up to that promise. Quests often feel disconnected from the main plot, and many NPCs come across as flat or forgettable, making it hard to stay invested in the world beyond its surface-level premise.

## Tropical Beauty, Repetition
Visually, the tropical setting is both a strength and a weakness. The sunny beaches and resort areas offer a refreshing contrast to the usual dark, decaying zombie environments, but this contrast sometimes clashes with the horror theme the game tries to establish. While the island looks appealing, the reused locations and limited enemy variety reinforce the sense of repetition. Overall, this title has some interesting ideas and moments of fun, but they are spread thin across an experience that feels longer and more tedious than it needs to be.
