## Strong Start, Weak Progression
This game is a first-person action RPG set on a tropical island overrun by zombies. The game mixes melee combat, exploration, and light RPG elements like leveling and weapon crafting, and while this may look interesting, it is not a big appeal to me, so I admit that the core mechanics of this game start off very interesting, but I quickly get tired of it. Weapons break way too easy and the progress system is too slow to follow the combat complexity and difficulty spikes.

## Designed for Co-op
Its open-world environment and co-op mode offer fun and chaotic moments, especially when played with friends. However, it's held back by technical issues, inconsistent tone, repetitive missions, and clunky combat. Despite its flaws, it found a niche audience and became a cult favorite for fans of zombie survival games. I admit that I didn't played this one up until the credits roll because it was simply not that interesting to me, maybe because I played the whole thing solo, so my advise is to play this in co-op mode.
