## Helpless Survival Horror
The first Amnesia entry is a survival horror classic from Frictional Games that redefined the genre when it released. Instead of giving players weapons or combat options, it makes you completely defenseless, forcing you to run or hide from grotesque creatures that stalk the corridors of a decaying castle. This sense of vulnerability is amplified by the game’s sanity system: staying in darkness or witnessing horrifying events slowly unravels Daniel’s mind, distorting vision and sound to create an even more terrifying atmosphere.

## Immersive Dread Design
The physics-based interactions, like manually opening doors or pulling objects, help immerse you in its world, making every action feel more tactile and tense. This was a standout at the time this released, similar to the fist time the gaming industry experienced the Half-Life 2 features for physics-based mechanics. Coupled with haunting sound design, oppressive visuals, and clever environmental storytelling, Amnesia creates a suffocating sense of dread that few horror games have matched.

## Lasting Horror Influence
This title is not for the weeks at heart, I consider myself very bullet-proof when it comes to scary titles, but this one got into my nerves, regardless. In my opinion it’s still considered one of the most influential horror games ever made, inspiring countless successors and streamers alike with its unique blend of helplessness and fear. This also helped popularize the "Lets Plays" YouTube videos at the time, which featured entire games being played, reacted and commented, in the video platform. One of the channels that exploded in popularity was the PewDiePie, with his funny an exaggerated reactions provoked by the game's horror scenes.
