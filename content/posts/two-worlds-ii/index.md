## Ambitious Yet Flawed
Two Worlds II is an ambitious open-world RPG that tries to deliver a rich fantasy experience but struggles with uneven execution. The game offers a large, explorable world with impressive environments, a deep magic system, and plenty of customization options. However, it's held back by clunky controls, awkward dialogue, and a stiff combat system, which for me was what made me not get past the 5h playtime mark.

## Improved but Janky
While improvements over the original are noticeable, it still feels rough around the edges. If you can overlook the jank, there's a surprisingly deep RPG underneath, but it’s not for everyone, I would recommend againts this similarly to the first Witcher game, both had great ideas for the time, but were poorly implemented and already outdated even for the standards of the time they were released.
