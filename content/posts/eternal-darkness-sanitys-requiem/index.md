## Meta Psychological Horror
This is one of the best psychological horror action-adventure games of all time, it stands out for its ambitious narrative, spanning multiple characters across centuries as they battle an ancient evil. What makes Eternal Darkness truly unique is its Sanity Meter system, as characters lose sanity, the game starts messing with the player, distorting audio, faking system errors, or making the screen appear to mute or delete save files. These meta-horror elements were groundbreaking and still influence horror games today.

## Cult Classic Innovation
Though the combat and visuals feel dated by modern standards, its Lovecraftian themes, clever storytelling, and psychological twists earned it critical acclaim, it's considered a cult classic and one of the most innovative horror titles of its era. I found out about this game on an YouTube channel and couldn't get it out of my mind until I saw the credits screen, it is simply an amazing experience with very unique mechanics, a shame this never had any sequels. It has a very good pacing since you often go back to the mansion area in order to investigate a bit further, so you are not overwhelmed with the action sequences. One of the best GC titles, definitely a must-play for this platform.
