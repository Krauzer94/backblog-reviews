## Grim Lovecraftian World
This title is a 2D isometric action RPG that mixes Lovecraftian horror with Soulslike mechanics. It features a grim, pixel-art world filled with grotesque enemies and challenging boss fights. Its dark, steampunk-inspired visuals and haunting soundtrack create a strong sense of dread and decay, which is one of its standout qualities. What made me interested in this game was the artstyle, I love pixel art and horror, so this is the perfect combination for me, and if you want to play this game solely because of this then I encourage you doing so.

## Flexible Yet Unbalanced Combat
Combat in Morbid offers a mix of melee and ranged attacks, giving players strategic flexibility. However, some mechanics, such as charge attacks and rolling, can feel overpowered, while parrying may come across as inconsistent. I recommend not trying too hard to optimize any kind of playstyle since this game won't leave much room for you to do this. You can upgrade your weapons using status effects gems, but there doesn't seem to be any clear way of finding the enemies weakness in order to make this more effective.

## Exploration Without Guidance
The interconnected world encourages exploration, but navigation can be tricky due to the lack of a detailed map and occasionally unclear progression paths. You can access the map in the bonfire-like statues, which are your checkpoints, but they are very simplistic, this lack of detail may seem daunting if you haven't explored the map before finding it. The game presents a challenging experience, though it is more accessible than many other Soulslike titles, making it approachable for newcomers to the genre.

## Atmospheric but Niche
It lacks a comprehensive New Game+ mode or multiple endings, which could have added replay value. Overall, this is a solid pick for fans of action RPGs and dark, atmospheric games, I would only recommend this if you are a big fan of Soulslike games, otherwise it is very skippable. Its haunting world and tough, engaging combat provide a satisfying experience, even if some design choices may limit its appeal to a broader audience.
