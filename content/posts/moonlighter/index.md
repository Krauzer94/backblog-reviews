## Addictive Core Loop
This game has an addictive gameplay loop, which combines shop management and dungeon crawling in a unique and enjoyable way. While the game can be difficult to grasp initially, players can rely on trial-and-error or research to master the mechanics. Dungeon exploration is compared to slow-paced Souls-like games due to its tactical elements, though it's not considered a full RPG. The game keeps things fresh with diverse enemies and constantly changing challenges, even if some sub-bosses are recycled. The main bosses start out tough but become easier later in the game, which might be a downside for those playing it as a single-player experience. The progression system is simple but rewarding, pushing players to grind for upgrades and enchantments. I'm excited for the sequel, though I may have a preference for the original 2D art style over the new 3D one, a trend seen in other games like Wizard of Legend.
