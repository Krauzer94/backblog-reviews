## Ambitious 90s RPG
This title is one of the most ambitious and memorable RPGs of the late 1990s. It stands out for its intricate storytelling, rich character development, and unique dual-layered combat system that blends traditional turn-based battles with mech-based "Gear" fights. The MC is called Fei Fong Wong, an amnesiac young man who becomes entangled in a vast and mysterious conflict spanning nations, ancient technology, and shadowy organizations. As the story unfolds, themes of identity, fate, religion, and human consciousness are explored with surprising depth for a video game of its era.

## Expansive World-Building
The world-building in Xenogears is expansive, the game introduces you to a variety of cultures, political intrigues, and moral dilemmas, giving a sense of scale and complexity that rivals even modern RPGs. The characters are equally compelling, Fei’s personal struggles are mirrored by the journeys of those around him, each with their own flaws, secrets, and motivations. The narrative does not shy away from mature and philosophical topics, making it a thought-provoking experience that resonates long after the credits roll. This one is indeed one of the golden era JRPG titles similar to FFVII, FFVI and both Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross games from back in the day.

## Dual-Layered Combat
The gameplay is multi-layered, on the surface, standard turn-based combat is solid and satisfying, with a strong emphasis on timed button presses to chain attacks and unleash combos. However, the standout feature is Gear combat, where you pilot giant mechs in tactical battles that feel both powerful and strategic. This dual-layered system adds depth and variety, keeping combat engaging throughout much of the game. Some mechanics, such as random encounters and extensive menu navigation, may feel cumbersome by today’s standards, but they were typical of the era.

## Memorable OST and Visuals
The OST is another highlight, ranging from emotional piano pieces to epic orchestral tracks, perfectly complementing the game’s dramatic moments. And this is not an unique trait of this title, it is indeed one of the best OSTs that I've ever experienced, and this is a common thing when it comes to JRPGs in general. Visually, the game blends 2D sprite-based characters with 3D environments, creating a distinctive style that still has charm today, even if it shows its age. I loved this aesthetic back in the day, started with titles such as Resident Evil, and I wished more games used this feature nowadays.

## Flawed Final Act
The game’s major criticism lies in its pacing and storytelling toward the end. Due to time and budget constraints, some plot elements are delivered through long text sequences rather than fully animated cutscenes, which can feel overwhelming. This is definitely one of the worst aspects of this title, I knew it before playing it for the first time, but I never thought it would be so bad as people made it out to be, and unfortunately, it is even worse than I thought. Despite this, the ending is still emotionally impactful and leaves a lasting impression.

## Timeless Narrative Masterpiece
Overall, this game is a masterpiece of narrative-driven RPG design. Its combination of deep storytelling, compelling characters, philosophical themes, and innovative combat make it a must-play for fans of classic role-playing games. While not perfect, it’s a game that remains influential and beloved decades after its release. It'll continue to influence other titles of today's JRPG modern games, one of them which I highly recommend is Chained Echoes, which has a similar two-layered combat system, quite similar to Xenogears. This game is definitely a must-play for fans of RPGs in general, not just of JRPGs, it is one of the best games of all time in my opinion, despite the last sections being one of the worst gaming experiences I've had.
