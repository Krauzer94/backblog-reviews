## Birth of Geralt
This game is a dark, narrative-driven RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, introducing the gritty world of Geralt of Rivia, on his first appearance in videogame history, a monster hunter navigating political intrigue and moral ambiguity. Based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s novels, the game stands out for its mature storytelling, branching dialogue choices, and deep lore rooted in Slavic mythology. The alchemy and timed-click combat system is unique, though it can feel clunky and awkward at times, which I confess that this was turned me off from actually finishing the entire game, so I dropped it after a few hours.

## Flawed Yet Influential
While the original release suffered from technical issues and long load times, the Enhanced Edition addressed many of these problems, so despite the game's design problems, if you are willing to play this, don't go for the original, and instead get the enhanced version. Visually and mechanically dated today, the game is still a compelling experience for those who value story and atmosphere over polish. It’s a flawed gem that laid the groundwork for one of the most respected RPG series in gaming.
