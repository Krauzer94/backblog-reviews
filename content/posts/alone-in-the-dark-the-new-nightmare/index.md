## Cinematic Survival Reboot
This entry rebooted the classic survival horror franchise with a darker, more cinematic tone inspired by Resident Evil. There are two MCs to play (another trait from RE) Edward Carnby or Aline Cedrac, exploring a mysterious island full of supernatural horrors. The game features fixed camera angles, tank controls, and puzzle-solving mixed with combat against shadowy creatures. Its lighting system was a standout for the time, flashlights dynamically illuminated environments, creating a tense atmosphere.

## Atmosphere Over Limitations
This was especially awesome at the time simply because there was no other game trying to use any lightning mechanics because of the technical limitations of the PlayStation platform. While the atmosphere and graphics were praised, it didn’t quite reach the polish or tension of its genre rivals. Some people criticized it for being more limited compared to other similar games at the time, though in my opinion the limitations makes this unique, not every game should be judged by the same rules since they don't intend to deliver the same experience.

## Essential Horror Classic
There are plenty of contents o this one since you can play using two MCs, different stories and gameplay, and back in the PlayStation 1 era you had two CDs for this, so there are plenty of a good time to be had here. I highly recommend not skipping this one, I consider it one of the best survival horror of all time, and a must-play for fans of the genre.
