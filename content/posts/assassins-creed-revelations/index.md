## Ezio’s Reflective Finale
This AC entry concludes Ezio Auditore’s trilogy with a mature, reflective tone and solid gameplay, which in my opinion was a perfect ending for the series as a whole, not just for Ezio. Set in the vibrant and detailed city of Constantinople, the game refines parkour and combat mechanics from previous titles and introduces new elements like the Hookblade and a bomb-crafting system, enhancing the RPG-like systems to improve game complexity and replayability.

## Lore-Rich Yet Repetitive
Ezio’s journey intertwines with flashbacks to Altair and Desmond, offering deeper lore and emotional weight, and the Altair sections were my favorite since the first title is my favorite AC title. However, mission variety can feel repetitive, and the tower defense mini-game was widely seen as unnecessary. Visually, it holds up well for its time, and the OST is once again excellent. This is a fitting end to Ezio’s story—familiar but polished. Best enjoyed by fans of the previous entries.
