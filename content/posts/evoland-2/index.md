## Evolving Through Eras
The second Evoland entry is a RPG from Shiro Games that builds on the concept of its predecessor by taking you on a journey through the history of video games. The game evolves visually and mechanically as you progress, starting with 8-bit graphics and gradually moving through 16-bit, 3D, and modern HD styles, each introducing new gameplay elements. So no big news on this regard, the game has practically the same mechanics of the first title, plus new and more polished additions.

## Humorous Time-Travel Tale
The MC is called Kuro, an amnesiac boy, and his companions as they travel through time to prevent a catastrophic event. The story is filled with humor, clever pop culture references, and nods to classic games, providing a nostalgic yet engaging narrative. This time around we have way more funny scenes than the first title, the devs were more authentic and less shy on this one since the previous title was relatively successful.

## Genre-Shifting Gameplay
The gameplay is diverse, blending action RPG mechanics, turn-based combat, platforming, rhythm challenges, and fighting sequences. This constant genre-shifting keeps the experience fresh, though it can sometimes feel jarring for players who prefer a more consistent style. It is amazing how well it transitions between the genres, you can even sometimes play a bullet-hell, and the a couple of moments later, you are playing a turn-based RPG, there are very few games which tries to implement this, and I find this awesome.

## Creative Retro Tribute
Some people have praised the game for its creativity, inventive approach, and homage to gaming history. Its "Very Positive" reception on Steam reflects the appreciation for its charm, humor, and imaginative design. While not flawless, Evoland 2 stands out as a unique and memorable RPG that appeals especially to fans of retro and classic gaming, there is no excuse to skip this one if you liked the previous title, and I think it is a must-play if you like adventure RPG games in general.
