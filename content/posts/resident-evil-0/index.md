## Atmospheric Prequel Remaster
This is a visually enhanced re-release of the 2002 GameCube prequel to the original Resident Evil 1 from the PlayStation 1 platform. The MCs this time are Rebecca and ex-military convict Billy Coen as they unravel the early horrors behind the Umbrella Corporation. Its moody, pre-rendered backdrops and haunting soundtrack create an oppressive atmosphere that fans of the series will appreciate, and the pre-rendered backgrounds were a surprise in the OG since there was a big trend at the time of not using 2D anymore, which was unfortunate since I love pre-rendered 2D backgrounds.

## Classic Survival Gameplay
The gameplay sticks closely to the classic survival horror formula, with fixed camera angles, limited resources, and a focus on puzzle-solving. A standout feature is the partner system, which lets players switch between Rebecca and Billy to explore different areas, solve puzzles, and support each other in combat. And while the franchise was never shy on having multiple playable characters, this was the first entry where you could actually play them simultaneously, with a much more seamless experience, rather than with scripted events such as the previous titles.

## Faithful Yet Dated
While tank controls were the standard in the original title, the remaster does include modern control options, which helps ease the transition for newer players. The story, while serviceable, doesn’t have the same impact or depth as other entries in the series, but I do like the characters and interactions very much, they are quite charismatic. Overall, Resident Evil 0 is a faithful and atmospheric return to the roots of survival horror. It’s a solid pick for long-time fans, though its dated mechanics and pacing might be off-putting to newcomers.
