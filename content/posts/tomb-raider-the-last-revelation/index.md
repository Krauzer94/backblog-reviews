## Puzzles, Myth, Atmosphere
This title takes us back to the franchise's roots with a tighter, Egypt-focused story steeped in mythology, the game features improved graphics and more refined controls over its predecessors, though still feels clunky by modern standards. Puzzle-solving takes center stage here, with more complex and interconnected level design that rewards patience and exploration, however, the backtracking and sometimes obscure objectives can be frustrating. The atmosphere is moody and immersive, thanks to strong visuals and sound design, sometimes it can even get you horror vibes, even straight out having some horror-themed levels. Overall, The Last Revelation is a solid, if slightly aged, entry in the series, best enjoyed by fans of the classic Tomb Raider formula who appreciate challenging puzzles and exploration, rather than some entries more focused on action.
