## Bold Gameplay Shift
Released for the PlayStation 2, it marked a bold shift for the FF series, introducing a real-time combat system with the Gambit mechanic, encouraging action automation (similar to MMORPG mechanics) and create strategic AI setups. Set in the richly detailed world of Ivalice, the game features political intrigue and war-driven storytelling that feels more grounded than previous entries, though some fans found the plot less emotionally engaging.

## Ivalice and Characters
And for fans of Vagrant Story, and Final Fantasy Tactics, this is a must-play since it is set in the same universe, and this makes the whole story and characters much more interesting. The visual presentation was outstanding for its time, with expansive environments and cinematic flair. The cast is diverse, though protagonist Vaan is often considered one of the weaker leads, with supporting characters like Balthier and Ashe receiving more praise, they are truly the ones that carries the plot forward.

## Divisive Yet Deep Combat
Its departure from traditional turn-based battles divided opinion, but many appreciated the fresh approach. Particularly I'm a big fan of this new system, I could spend hours playing around with the combat automation system, while at the same time, this is a great title to play while "idle" (e.g: listening to something like a band album, a podcast, etc). One of my favorite mechanics is the hunting system, on a surface level if adds a little bit of extra layer of complexity, side-quests and gives you much more playtime, but when you go deep into this system and try to perform all the hunts, you find out a whole metagame, this is one of the most challenging mechanics through all FF titles I've played so far.
