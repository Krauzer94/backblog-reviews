## Zombie Survival Crafting
The first How to Survive title is a top-down, action-survival game set on a zombie-infested tropical archipelago. It blends Hack'N Slash combat with light RPG elements and a clever crafting system. The core gameplay revolves around scavenging for food, water, and materials to survive, while fighting off increasingly aggressive undead enemies. The game stands out for its humorous tone, especially through the “Kovac’s Rules” survival guides narrated by an eccentric masked character, which inject a quirky charm into the otherwise grim setting.

## Memorable Humorous Guide
And trust me when I say this, this character carries the whole game, from start to finish, it is indeed the big standout, you'll have it's quotes and voice into your memory for a very long time after playing this. Crafting is one of its strongest features, allowing you to combine items into makeshift weapons and gear, it is a must mechanic since supplies are very rare, even at the regular difficulty level. Combat is responsive and satisfying, particularly when using crafted weapons like explosive arrows or homemade chainsaws.

## Fun Yet Repetitive
Local and online co-op modes also enhance the experience by turning the survival challenge into a fun, shared adventure, though one I could not experience myself, unfortunately. However, the game suffers from repetitive environments and quests, with a lot of backtracking that can make the gameplay feel tedious over time. The user interface and tutorials can also be clunky, often interrupting the flow of the action. Its short campaign, often under three hours, means that the experience may feel too brief for players looking for depth or replayability.
