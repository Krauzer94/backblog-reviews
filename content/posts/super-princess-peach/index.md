## Emotional Peach Adventure
This title offers a charming reversal of the classic Mario formula by casting Princess Peach as the hero for once. You need to save Mario, Luigi, and Toad that were kidnapped by Bowser, armed not with fireballs, but with her emotions. The game’s central gimmick, the “Vibe Scepter,” lets Peach channel her feelings, joy, rage, gloom, and calm, to affect the environment and solve puzzles. It’s a creative system that gives the game a distinct identity, even if it sometimes leans too heavily on the emotional theme for humor.

## Colorful, Gentle Platforming
Visually, the game shines with colorful, storybook-style graphics and a cheerful soundtrack that fits the DS’s bright aesthetic. Levels are easy to navigate, and the platforming feels smooth and forgiving, making it approachable for younger audiences. However, seasoned fans may find the difficulty too low and the gameplay loop somewhat repetitive after a while. I don't particularly hate this title being easy, sometimes it is good to have a more lightweight experience such as this one.

## Charming Lighthearted Journey
Despite these flaws, this game remains an enjoyable and lighthearted adventure that gives its long-overlooked heroine a well-deserved starring role. It’s not the most challenging platformer, but it’s one of the most charming and unique entries in the Mario universe. I would only recommend this for fans of the Mario franchise, it is a very pleasant experience, but it is not as special as the mainline games of the series.
