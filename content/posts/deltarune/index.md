## Chapter 3: Fast-Paced Fun
Chapter 3: another banger from Toby, loved the new villain and the new songs, had a blast playing through the mini-games, felt like a really fast-paced and rushed chapter though, wished it was more similar to the previous ones where you go through the adventure and the main villain is far from your reach, and this was quite the opposite. But I get it, the structure he opted to go for would only work on this specific format, and regardless I really enjoyed it, though this has little to no mysteries so far for me, at least not ones that I can spot.

## Chapter 4: Serious Developments
Chapter 4: The last chapter is definitely the most serious one we got up until now, very different from the previous two we had which were very similar in structure, we had character development, comedy and also some serious parts, but chapter 4 is a completely "serious" chapter in comparison. While chapter 3 was a complete laugh from start to finish, chapter 4 is the complete opposite, introducing a new mysterious villain, and ending with an (obvious) cliff hanger, not as big as the one in chapter 2 though, since at least now we have more clues about what can or cannot go down in the future episodes.

## New Mechanics & Community
I loved the new mechanics being introduced, like the simple but fun climbing mechanic and also the Guitar Hero one, in which I wasted almost 4 entire hours trying to get S-ranks on all songs and difficulty levels (I couldn't). Now I'll enjoy one of my favorite parts of playing Toby's games, the "post-game content" of going through +10 hours of YouTube videos about theories, mysteries and engaging with the community about what is to come in the future episodes, I love it, though the community is, unfortunately, not always really nice to engage with haha.
