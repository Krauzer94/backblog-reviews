## Psychological Horror Atmosphere
Unlike the more action-oriented Resident Evil, Silent Hill focuses on psychological horror, crafting a deeply unsettling atmosphere through eerie fog, disturbing imagery, and an unsettling sound design by Akira Yamaoka, and this was a very original approach at the time. The game excels at blending tense exploration with cryptic puzzles and grotesque enemies, its grainy visuals, partly due to hardware limitations (e.g. limited draw distance replaced by the fog), actually enhance the fear factor, giving the game a dreamlike, nightmarish quality.

## Enduring Horror Classic
Though the combat and controls can feel clunky by modern standards, the storytelling, atmosphere, and emotional depth were revolutionary for its time. Silent Hill is a horror classic that helped redefine the genre, a chilling masterpiece that still haunts players decades later, and a must-play for the PlayStation platform. I remember having a really hard time going through the puzzles since I didn't knew english when I was younger, so I replayed it decades later, and they are still not a walk in the park haha.
