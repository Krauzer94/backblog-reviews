## 32-Bit X Evolution
This video-game is a standout entry in the Mega Man X series, marking the franchise's leap into 32-bit territory with vibrant hand-drawn sprites, anime cutscenes, and a refined soundtrack, similar to what happened before with the first Mega Man X in the SNES platform, a big leap from the 8-bit Mega Man (non-X) franchise. The game lets players choose between X and Zero, each with distinct playstyles, X with long-range blasts and Zero with fast-paced melee combat. The platforming is tight, bosses are memorable, and the overall difficulty is challenging but fair, while the voice acting is infamously bad, I see this as a plus in my books, it adds charm to an otherwise polished and exciting action platformer.

## Balanced X Classic
I highly recommend not skipping this one since it is the most balanced out of all the 2D Mega Man X titles from the PlayStation platform, particularly I recommend playing with both of the playable characters, since the level design is so balanced that there is no downside in doing so, compared to other entries in the series. There are lots of secrets to discover, similar to other titles of the franchise, but this one definitely has less things to do compared to the later entries, a must-play classic of the PlayStation platform.
