## Clunky First Impressions
I went into How to Survive 2 hoping it would build on what I liked about the first game, but after a few hours I just couldn’t stay invested. The opening felt slow and unnecessarily clunky, with systems that seemed more complicated than fun. Where the original struck a nice balance of survival mechanics and action, this sequel felt bogged down by tedious base-building and grindy resource management.

## Lost Atmosphere Charm
The atmosphere also didn’t grab me the way the first game did. The environments looked bland and repetitive, and the charm of the original’s tone was missing. Even though I enjoyed crafting and scavenging before, here it felt like busywork rather than something rewarding. Playing solo especially made the whole experience feel flat, and the lack of a compelling story didn’t help.

## Disappointing Sequel Direction
For me, the first game was a pleasant surprise, but this one turned into a disappointment. Instead of improving on what worked, it added layers that made the experience less enjoyable. I couldn’t find the motivation to push further, and it left me wishing I had just replayed the original instead. The biggest downside for me is the focus in the coop experience, making this a very poor experience for people who choose to play this alone.
