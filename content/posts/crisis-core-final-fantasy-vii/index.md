## Zack Fair’s Tragedy
This game offers a rich backstory centered on Zack Fair, a character previously shrouded in mystery and first introduced in the Final Fantasy VII from PlayStation 1. The game blends real-time action combat with RPG elements, a notable shift from the series’ traditional turn-based roots, and it suits the handheld format well. The story adds emotional depth to the FFVII universe, especially as it explores themes of honor, identity, and sacrifice. While the Digital Mind Wave (DMW) slot machine mechanic can feel a bit too random, and I admit that I'm not particularly a fan of this mechanic, the game's heartfelt narrative, strong voice acting, and beautiful cutscenes more than make up for it. It’s a must-play for fans of the original and a standout PSP title.

## Compelling Story Focus
I had a blast playing this title because it felt like I was playing the Vincent title, but now with a much more relevant character, since Vincent was actually an optional one in the original. This is one of those games you can't put down until you reach the credits, it's pacing is simply phenomenal, you never get bored and the combat sequences are satisfying enough while also having a balanced challenge. Though compared to other entries of the FFVII universe, this tends to be more simplistic when it comes to the combat, what I enjoyed the most was actually the story and characters.

## Supporting Cast Impact
Another aspect that really stood out to me was how well the game uses its supporting cast to elevate Zack’s journey. Characters like Angeal and Genesis may be divisive for some fans, but I appreciated how they serve as philosophical foils, constantly challenging Zack’s ideals and sense of duty. Their presence helps contextualize SOLDIER not just as an elite force, but as a place where loyalty, ambition, and personal values often clash. By the time the story reaches its later chapters, the emotional weight feels fully earned, and even knowing how things must end doesn’t lessen the impact.

## Technical Excellence
On a technical level, the game is remarkably impressive for a PSP title, the OST, as usual, perfectly complements both the high-energy combat and the quieter, more reflective moments, often enhancing the emotional punch of key scenes. Visually, the cutscenes still hold up well, and the art direction captures the tone of the FFVII universe. Overall, this game feels like a carefully crafted bridge between lore expansion and character-driven storytelling, and it left a lasting impression on me long after I put the console down.
