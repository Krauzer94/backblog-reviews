## Skill-Based Melee Combat
This title is a multiplayer-focused action game that stands out for its unique melee combat system. Instead of button-mashing, fights rely on timing, positioning, and reading opponents, making duels feel tense and rewarding. The factions, Knights, Vikings, and Samurai, are brought to life with distinct playstyles and strong visual design, which adds variety and personality to the battlefield.

## Technical and Progression Issues
I honestly couldn't get into this title due to the lack of servers here in South America, but the very few matches that I managed to play showed me the potential this game has. At launch, technical issues like peer-to-peer networking and connection problems also frustrated a lot of people, including myself, as already mentioned. And the progression system felt grind-heavy with its reliance on in-game currency and microtransactions, which is a common plague of this company's games nowadays.

## A Unique Multiplayer Niche
Despite its flaws, For Honor delivers an intense and strategic multiplayer experience that rewards patience and skill. For people who value competitive melee combat, it offers something distinct and memorable, even if it demands time and persistence to fully enjoy. It is definitely a standout in the competitive online multiplayer world, since most games are either a fighting or a shooter, this is a nice change of pace, unfortunately not everybody could enjoy playing it.
