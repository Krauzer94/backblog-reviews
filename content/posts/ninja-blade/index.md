## Neo-Ninja Apocalypse
This game is an action game developed by FromSoftware, set in a near-future Tokyo. The MC is called Ken Ogawa, a neo-ninja fighting a parasitic outbreak that turns humans into monstrous mutants. The game emphasizes fast-paced combat with multiple weapons and a chi-based "ninja vision" system. Boss battles often involve quick-time events, which add cinematic flair but can become overwhelming.

## Derivative Yet Accessible
This one really feels like a 360-era Ninja Gaiden rip-off, not very unique but it at least made it possible to have a similar experience on PC at the time, since Ninja Gaiden was a 360 exclusive back in the day. The PC version of Ninja Blade was criticized for technical issues, including glitches, crashes, and performance problems. The port lacked official updates or mod support, which left many of these problems unresolved and diminished the overall experience.

## Mixed Reception Legacy
Some praised its over-the-top style and cinematic moments, describing it as silly but fun, while others found it lackluster, comparing it unfavorably to Ninja Gaiden and God of War. Overall, it received mixed reviews and holds a "Mixed or Average" score on Metacritic, a game that had great potential but lacked courage to become much more unique compared to a lot of other similar games at the time.

## Skippable Cinematic Action
My biggest issue with this game are the bossfights, they are it's weakest point, lasting too long and not having any interesting enough mechanic, not to mention it has a very high amount of them. It offers a visually striking and action-packed experience, best suited for players looking for a straightforward, cinematic game, but I really consider this a very skippable game, there are many other similar title with higher quality.
