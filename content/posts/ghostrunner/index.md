## Fluid Cyberpunk Action
This title is a fast-paced first-person action platformer set in a neon-soaked cyberpunk dystopia. It blends wall-running, sliding, dashing, and precise swordplay into a fluid rhythm that rewards skill and punishes hesitation. Every encounter feels like a puzzle of movement and timing, pushing players to chain together perfect runs through deadly environments.

## Punishing Skill-Based Difficulty
The game’s difficulty is one of its defining traits, death comes instantly from a single mistake, but generous checkpoints and quick reloads keep the momentum flowing. So if you don't like games with "easy-death" mechanics, stir away from this one, because it'll not be a good time for you. Mastering its mechanics delivers a genuine rush, though some players may find the trial-and-error design frustrating.

## Stylish Aesthetic and Sound
Visually, it stands out with its stylish cyberpunk aesthetic, sharp animations, and pulsing electronic soundtrack that perfectly matches the intensity of the gameplay. And even though I'm highly biased because I'm a Synthwave fan, I still think this game has a very amazing OST, it is definitely one of it's standouts. The narrative, however, plays only a minor role and often feels like background noise compared to the adrenaline of the action, it is still there, but very lacking and with very few to no characters involved on it.

## Demanding Yet Rewarding Experience
Overall, Ghostrunner is a thrilling but demanding experience, it is best suited for people who enjoy fast reflex challenges and the satisfaction of overcoming brutally precise gameplay rather than those seeking a story-driven adventure. I highly recommend this if you like difficult games to any extent, it is truly one of the best of it's kind, no excuse not to play it.
