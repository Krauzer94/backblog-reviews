## Tactical Hostage Gameplay
This title is a relatively obscure action-adventure game that attempted to combine tactical gameplay with a hostage-rescue narrative. You control an elite commando team sent to infiltrate a skyscraper taken over by terrorists, with the goal of saving hostages and neutralizing threats. One of it's most notable features is the ability to switch between multiple characters, each with distinct abilities and combat styles. It almost makes you feel like you are playing a party RPG, since all the character have vastly different playstyles, about all that is missing is a progression system and a less simplistic combat system. This mechanic encourages you to approach situations strategically, rather than relying on a single playstyle, and adds a layer of depth that distinguishes it from many other action games of the era.

## Exploration And Frustration
The levels themselves include a mix of exploration and puzzle-solving, requiring you to navigate the building, unlock doors, and locate hostages while avoiding or confronting enemies. And the enemies respawn indefinitely, but they give you a fair amount of breathing room so you don't get tired of this, while also giving you more resources when you defeat them. Despite its promising premise, the game suffers from several major drawbacks. The controls are widely considered cumbersome, with slow movement and tank-like handling that make combat and navigation frustrating. While I don't really get bothered much by tank controls, they are very bad on this game, your character tries to avoid obstacles on it's own, automatically, and this is a recipe for disaster. Aiming and attacking often feel unresponsive, which can turn tense moments into tedious struggles.

## Weak AI And Story
Enemy AI is weak and predictable, and encounters frequently lack challenge or engagement. The hit detection can also be inconsistent, further undermining combat satisfaction. These gameplay issues are compounded by a story and presentation that fail to leave a strong impression. Dialogue is generic, voice acting is underwhelming, and the characters themselves are mostly forgettable, making it difficult for you to become invested in the narrative or the team they control. At the same time, at this point in time in gaming history, not all games were mature enough. So I don't fault this one for not having a better quality overall, but I can safely say that it can sometimes be laughable to experience, such as the cutscenes. On the positive side, this game offers a certain retro charm that may appeal to collectors and fans of early PlayStation experimentation.

## Mixed Mechanics, Low Replay
The concept of managing a small team with different skills is interesting and provides some variety in how missions are approached. Additionally, the game’s combination of action and light puzzle elements gives it a slightly different flavor compared to other PS1 titles focused solely on combat or horror. However, the lack of polish and the frustrating control scheme significantly limit its appeal. Replay value is minimal, as missions can feel repetitive and there is little incentive to revisit completed levels. In conclusion, this title is a flawed but curious piece of PlayStation history. It shows ambition in its tactical team mechanics and hostage-rescue premise, yet it is held back by clunky controls, weak combat, and uninspired presentation.

## Retro Appeal Only
For people who enjoy retro PS1 games and are curious about lesser-known titles, it may offer a nostalgic experience. However, for those seeking tight gameplay, intelligent AI, or a compelling story, T.R.A.G. is unlikely to provide a satisfying experience. It remains more of a historical curiosity than a hidden gem in the PlayStation library. I would only invest any time on this title if you, like myself, is a die-hard fan of survival horror, RE and PlayStation era games, otherwise, this is a very skippable title. And in fact, I only got to know and play this game because I was curious about "RE-clones", and ended up finding this gem, was worth my time since it is a very short experience. A shame it has practically no replay value, which is an important thing on this genre in particular.
