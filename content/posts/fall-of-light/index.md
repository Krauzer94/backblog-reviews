## Promising First Impressions
I went into Fall of Light really wanting to like it, the premise felt strong, the atmosphere was moody and intriguing, and the bond between the father and daughter gave the story a weight that pulled me in at first. The lighting effects and art direction made some areas genuinely beautiful to look at, and for a while I kept pushing forward, hoping the game would open up into something memorable.

## Frustration Takes Over
Unfortunately, the deeper I went, the more the flaws began to overshadow the promise. The controls often felt sluggish, combat rarely felt satisfying, and escorting Aether quickly turned into a constant source of frustration. I lost count of the number of times she got stuck, left behind, or put me in situations that felt unfair rather than challenging. On top of that, crashes, input delays, and even one game-breaking bug completely killed my momentum.

## Potential Left Unfulfilled
I kept telling myself to stick with it, that maybe things would improve or the story would pay off in a big way, but every session left me more drained than invested. Eventually, I hit a point where it stopped feeling like an adventure and more like a chore. As much as I wanted to see it through, I had to put the controller down and walk away, disappointed that a game with such potential ended up being something I just couldn’t finish.
