## Refined Platforming Evolution
This is a polished and highly enjoyable sequel that improves on the original in nearly every way, it introduces tighter controls, smoother animations, and more varied level design. The hub-based level structure offers non-linear progression, and new moves like the slide and belly flop add depth to the gameplay. While still challenging, it feels more fair and refined than its predecessor. With its vibrant visuals, catchy soundtrack, and iconic platforming, it stands out as one of the best 3D platformers of its era.

## Crash’s True Sweet Spot
This title is when Crash reached it's sweet spot, feeling way less clunky and slow compared to the first title, not to mention the levels are way more varied, this helps a lot by mixing the challenge so it prevents the game from becoming repetitive. The main selling point for me is the new dash mechanic, which was very much a needed feature in the first title, not just to make the platforming more fun, but also to make it less punishing, since the first game is, in my opinion, unbalanced.
