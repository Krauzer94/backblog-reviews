## Dark Sengoku Souls
The first Nioh entry is a challenging action RPG from Team Ninja, often described as a mix between Dark Souls and Ninja Gaiden. Set in a dark fantasy version of Sengoku-era Japan, the MC is called William, a Western samurai, battling humans and yokai (demon creatures from the Japanese folklore).

## Deep Stance Combat
The combat is its strongest feature: fast, precise, and built around multiple weapon types, stances, and Ki (stamina) management. Making the combat look like a precise resource management dance, even more so than the regular Dark Souls games, and with more flashy visuals. Mastering these mechanics feels rewarding, and boss fights are intense and memorable.

## Diablo-Style Loot
The loot system, however, is heavily inspired by Diablo-style RPGs, meaning lots of gear drops that can feel repetitive or overwhelming. Particularly I really hate this kind of approach, it makes everything look generic unoriginal, fortunately you can re-skin any armor and weapon into other ones that you already found through the game. I used this a lot in order to enjoy the the most out of the "fashion-souls" experience.

## Controller-Recommended PC Port
The PC port added improved graphics options and unlocked framerate, but had some launch issues with keyboard/mouse controls (a controller is strongly recommended). This is a demanding but highly satisfying action RPG for fans of deep combat systems and Japanese mythology, best enjoyed with a controller. I highly recommend this for fans of the Souls-like genre, it is one of the best of it's kind.
