## A Cinematic Pacific War
MoH: Rising Sun is a PS2 FPS set during World War II in the Pacific theater, which at the time was not a very explored topic, even though WWII was not an uncommon subject in shooters. The game starts strong with an intense recreation of the Pearl Harbor attack, delivering cinematic action and dramatic set-pieces that were impressive for its time, which was a trait of this franchise since the first title, though now we got a much more technologically powerful platform to work with, compared to the PS1.

## Inconsistent Yet Memorable
However, after the opening, the gameplay becomes inconsistent, the AI is often clumsy, and the level design ranges from exciting to frustratingly linear. The controls and aiming feel a bit clunky compared to other shooters of that era, and at the time this was excusable since using both analog sticks was not a very common thing. Despite these flaws, the game features a solid soundtrack, which was a standout since it brings a lot of value to the cinematic aspects of the franchise, and offers a cooperative split-screen mode, which was a fun extra.

## Narrative Loses Focus
Narratively, it struggles to maintain momentum after its explosive introduction. The story feels loosely stitched together, with missions jumping between locations without giving enough time to develop a strong sense of progression or attachment to the characters. While the Pacific setting remains refreshing, the campaign rarely takes full advantage of it, often falling back on familiar objectives that lack the emotional weight and tension the opening mission promised.

## A Transitional Chapter
Overall, this title feels like a transitional entry for the series rather than a defining one. It shows ambition and occasional brilliance, but also reveals the growing pains of a franchise trying to adapt to a new generation of hardware and evolving FPS standards. While it may disappoint those revisiting it today, especially when compared to later genre-defining titles, it still holds nostalgic value and stands as an interesting snapshot of early-2000s console shooters.
