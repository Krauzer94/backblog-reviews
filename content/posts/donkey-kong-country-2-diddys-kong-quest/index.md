## Atmospheric Platforming Perfection
Developed by Rare, it improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way, offering tighter controls, more complex level design, and a darker, more atmospheric tone. You play as Diddy Kong and newcomer Dixie Kong, each with unique abilities that enhance gameplay variety, the game features a rich, moody soundtrack, one of the best soundtracks on a video-game through all gaming history, and striking pre-rendered visuals that pushed the SNES hardware to its limits. It's challenging but fair, with loads of secrets and collectibles that reward exploration, definitely a standout 16-bit classic with depth, style, and replayability.

## Perfectly Designed Classic
This is my favorite SNES DK game, Diddy is simply the most delightful character to play as, and the level design is simply perfect when you match both playable characters, and the challenges you are about to face. Similar to the first title, there are several different mount options as your animal friends, and this time they are even more fun than the first entry. I highly recommend doing doin 100% on this one, it is one of the best games to 100%, not just on the SNES platform, but of all gaming history.
