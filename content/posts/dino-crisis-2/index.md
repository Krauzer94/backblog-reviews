## Arcade-Style Dino Action
This Capcom entry is a fast-paced, action-heavy sequel that shifts away from the survival horror tone of the original game in favor of arcade-style gameplay. It puts you against relentless waves of dinosaurs in a time-warped jungle environment. You control Regina, from the first game, and also a newcomer Dylan, switching between them across varied missions with upgraded weapons and an in-game point system for purchases. Unlike its predecessor, Dino Crisis 2 emphasizes combat over tension, offering thrilling set pieces, large-scale dinosaur battles, and smooth controls. The graphics and pre-rendered backgrounds are impressive for the time, and the game maintains a solid pace throughout.

## High Replay Value
While fans of the original’s suspenseful atmosphere might miss the horror elements, the sequel delivers a fun, adrenaline-fueled experience that stands out as one of the more unique action titles on the PlayStation. This title had peak replay value at the time, since there was a very high number of things you could unlock, ways you could play, and also the upgrades you could choose from, depending on the weapons and equipment you liked the most to play with. This is definitely one of the best PlayStation titles, and a must-play for this platform.
