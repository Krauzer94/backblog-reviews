## Stylish Cyberpunk Horror
The first entry to the Fear Effect franchise is a stylish action-adventure game that is best remembered for its striking cel-shaded visual style and cinematic presentation, which stood out at the time. The story mixes cyberpunk and supernatural themes, following mercenaries on a dark, neon-soaked journey through futuristic Hong Kong and into the Chinese underworld. Gameplay combines puzzle-solving with third-person shooting, though the fixed camera angles and tank-like controls can feel clunky by modern standards.

## Fear Gauge Cult Classic
The “fear gauge” system is unique: instead of a traditional health bar, characters’ stress levels affect survivability, adding tension to encounters. Although this may sound like an unique mechanic, in reality, it works similar to traditional ones that serve the same purpose. While its visuals and atmosphere were praised, the game was criticized for stiff controls and sometimes frustrating difficulty. Overall, this title is a cult classic, more about mood, story, and style than smooth gameplay. This is a must-play for fans of the survival horror genre, especially if you don't mind retro games and can endure some outdated mechanics.

## Cutscene-Heavy Retro Experience
Despite it being a very short title, it had a lot of discs for the PlayStation, in order to experience the whole game, I figure this should be because of the amount of cutscenes. My biggest complain about this title is the amount of scripted sequences, fortunately, I played using an emulator, so I could abuse the save state feature. But I wouldn't recommend playing this in the original platforms, it would not be a good experience. A standout for me is the amount of playable characters, and how their stories are linked, this makes the game much more dynamic compared to others of the same genre. This is a very unique game, not just for it's genre, but overall, I highly recommend not skipping this one.
