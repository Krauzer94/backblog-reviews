## Tactical Cooperative Shooter
This title is a free, top-down, cooperative shooter that builds upon the original Alien Swarm. The game features updated graphics, new campaigns, and additional weapons and equipment, providing both fresh content and a polished experience. Its tactical, squad-based gameplay remains at the core, encouraging strategic teamwork. Sometimes this feels like you are playing a top-down Deep Rock Galactic, made using Valve's Source Egine.

## Flexible Multiplayer Options
You can engage in co-op missions with up to eight participants or test their skills in PvP modes like Deathmatch and Gun Game. The game also supports single-player play with AI-controlled bots, making it accessible for those without a team. Steam Workshop integration allows for community-created content, ensuring a steady flow of new challenges and customization.

## Community-Driven Replayability
The game has been praised for its replayability and cooperative gameplay, as well as for being free and well-optimized. However, newcomers may face a steep learning curve due to limited tutorials. Despite this, Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop stands out as a community-driven shooter that is both engaging and accessible for tactical gameplay fans. I played it a little bit with some friends, but they didn't enjoyed it very much, unfortunately.
