## Promising But Unengaging
This videogame looked promising at first, a 1960s Cold War setting, XCOM branding, and the idea of blending squad tactics with a third-person shooter. This was my first XCOM game and it looked interesting enough to me, because I was used to similar games at the time, but after a few hours, it just didn’t click. The atmosphere feels underused, the story is slow to get going, and the gameplay looked interesting in trailers and reviews, but did not managed to catch my attention long enough. The squad commands are clunky, and the early missions feel repetitive. It’s not bad exactly, but it didn’t hook me enough to keep going, it might please fans of the series though.
