## Enhanced Classic Run-and-Gun
This title is an enhanced port of Metal Slug 7 originally made for the Nintendo DS. It refines the classic run-and-gun gameplay with smoother visuals, sharper sprites, and an overall better presentation suited to the PSP’s widescreen display. The game stays true to the franchise’s fast-paced, chaotic shooting action filled with explosions, vehicles, and the series’ trademark humor.

## Co-op and Challenges
The addition of local co-op play via ad hoc mode gives Metal Slug XX a big boost in fun, allowing two people to tackle missions together. The Combat School mode also adds replay value by offering dozens of bite-sized challenges that test your skills beyond the main seven stages. Leona from The King of Fighters is available as a playable character, expanding the roster and adding a bit of freshness for long-time fans.

## Tough but Familiar
However, the game doesn’t bring much innovation to the formula. The campaign is short, and some levels feel overly punishing due to enemy spam and limited continues, which can frustrate newcomers. But if you are a fan of the frachise, or this is not your first title, then it won't be a big issue, though I admit that this is not a walk in the park, and it feels a bit harder than other games of the same franchise.

## Stylish Handheld Action
While the visuals look great, the PSP’s small screen can make the action hard to follow when things get too hectic. Overall, this game is a solid handheld entry that captures the essence of the series, intense, stylish, and challenging. It’s best enjoyed by fans who appreciate old-school arcade gameplay and don’t mind a bit of repetition, but it may not impress people looking for something new.
