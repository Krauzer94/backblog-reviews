## Gothic Hero Redemption
The first MediEvil entry for the PlayStation 1 is a cult classic that stands out for its mix of gothic style, humor, and action-adventure gameplay. The MC is called Sir Daniel Fortesque, a knight who was mistakenly remembered as a great hero after dying in the first charge of battle. When the evil sorcerer Zarok returns, Dan is accidentally resurrected, giving him a second chance to prove himself as the hero he was never truly meant to be.

## Burtonesque Style Showcase
The game blends hack-and-slash combat with light platforming and puzzle-solving, spread across imaginative levels like eerie graveyards, haunted villages, and twisted forests. Its visual design, with crooked architecture and spooky environments, feels inspired by Tim Burton’s films, creating an atmosphere that is both creepy and playful. It's visuals is the standout for me, I'm a big fan of Burton's art-style. The soundtrack, filled with dramatic orchestral and choir arrangements, heightens the dark fairytale mood.

## Aged Yet Charming
That said, the game shows its age, the camera can be frustrating, and the controls sometimes feel stiff, and honestly no 3D game back in PlayStation 1 had camera controls, this is just another example. Still, these flaws are outweighed by the charm of its world, the humor of its characters, and the satisfaction of unlocking new weapons and abilities as you progress. For me, this remains as a beloved PS1 title, remembered for its personality and style as much as for its gameplay, I recommend trying to play this in the new re-releases/remakes for modern platforms, rather than the OG title.
