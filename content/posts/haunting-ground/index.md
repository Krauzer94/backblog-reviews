## Companionship and Survival
This title is a psychological survival horror game that stands out for its haunting atmosphere and unique companion mechanics. The MC is called Fiona Belli, a young woman who wakes up trapped inside a gothic castle after a car accident. Isolated and defenseless, she must rely on her companion, a dog named Hewie, to explore the castle, solve puzzles, and evade relentless pursuers. The relationship between Fiona and Hewie is central to the experience, with trust and obedience shaping how effectively he can help you survive.

## Oppressive Horror Atmosphere
The game’s greatest strength lies in its tension and atmosphere. The eerie castle feels oppressive and alive, filled with unsettling details and threatening stalkers who pursue Fiona with disturbing persistence. The panic system, which distorts the screen and controls when Fiona is frightened, is an inspired touch that immerses the player in her vulnerability. Visually, it makes impressive use of the PS2’s hardware, delivering realistic environments and lighting that amplify the dread.

## Slow, Tense Gameplay
However, the game’s structure can become repetitive, cycling through a pattern of being hunted, hiding, and solving puzzles. The pacing is deliberate and slow, which enhances tension but may frustrate players expecting faster action. Though if you come to this game expecting something like modern Resident Evil, than this one is not for you, this title is even slower than the very first RE entry, which is great for fans of oldschool survival horror. The controls are somewhat stiff, and while the story’s premise is intriguing, it doesn’t always deliver deep character development or a strong narrative payoff.

## Cult Horror Classic
Despite these flaws, this game remains a memorable and underrated entry in the survival horror genre. Its focus on fear, helplessness, and psychological unease, combined with the emotional bond between Fiona and Hewie, gives it a distinctive identity. Though some people gave it mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a loyal cult following for its atmosphere, originality, and haunting tone. This is a must-play if you are a fan of survival horror, especially if you like the more slower versions of them like the first entries of RE an Silent Hill.
