## Birth of a Legend
The very first God of War is a brutal, cinematic action-adventure that redefined the Hack'N Slash genre, the MC is Kratos, a rage-fueled Spartan warrior on a quest to kill Ares, the Greek god of war. The game blends fast-paced, combo-heavy combat with epic mythological storytelling and larger-than-life boss battles. Its fixed camera angles, fluid controls, and immersive level design still hold up remarkably well. While some platforming sections can feel dated, the game’s visceral tone, mature narrative, and unforgettable moments make it a PlayStation 2 classic and a must-play for fans of action games. This is truly one of the best games of all time, it set a lot of standards that are followed even for today's game development in general.

## Genre-Defining Legacy
Not just when it comes to it's genre, but also when it comes to story-telling and such. This is especially true if we talk about it's reboot, which I'll review in the future, and the first entry is absolutely a not skippable title, play it any way you can, OG, re-releases, remasters, you name it, this is one of gaming's best titles of all time. And it is also one of the most challenging ones, almost feeling unbalanced at this, since this was a very ambitious first entry that tried to do a lot, but at least it failed very rarely. I also recommend trying to 100% this since it's challenges are very fun, but brutally difficult at times.
