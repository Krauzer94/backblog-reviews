## Birth of a Legend
The very first God of War is a brutal, cinematic action-adventure that redefined the Hack'N Slash genre, the MC is Kratos, a rage-fueled Spartan warrior on a quest to kill Ares, the Greek god of war. The game blends fast-paced, combo-heavy combat with epic mythological storytelling and larger-than-life boss battles. Its fixed camera angles, fluid controls, and immersive level design still hold up remarkably well. While some platforming sections can feel dated, the game’s visceral tone, mature narrative, and unforgettable moments make it a PlayStation 2 classic and a must-play for fans of action games. This is truly one of the best games of all time, it set a lot of standards that are followed even for today's game development in general.

## Genre-Defining Legacy
Not just when it comes to it's genre, but also when it comes to story-telling and such. This is especially true if we talk about it's reboot, which I'll review in the future, and the first entry is absolutely a not skippable title, play it any way you can, OG, re-releases, remasters, you name it, this is one of gaming's best titles of all time. And it is also one of the most challenging ones, almost feeling unbalanced at this, since this was a very ambitious first entry that tried to do a lot, but at least it failed very rarely. I also recommend trying to 100% this since it's challenges are very fun, but brutally difficult at times.

## Groundbreaking Presentation
Another standout aspect of the original title is its presentation, which was nothing short of groundbreaking for its time. The seamless transitions between gameplay and cinematic cutscenes made the experience feel like an interactive Greek tragedy, something rarely achieved so effectively on the PlayStation 2. The orchestral OST, combined with powerful voice acting, elevated every encounter, making even standard battles feel epic. Boss fights against iconic figures like the Hydra or Pandora’s Guardian were not just tests of skill, but memorable set pieces that showcased the game’s ambition and technical prowess.

## Enduring Legacy
Despite its age, the first this title remains remarkably relevant today because of how confidently it established its identity. It introduced a protagonist who was flawed, violent, and tragic, setting the foundation for one of gaming’s most compelling character arcs. While later entries would refine and evolve many of its ideas, this original title deserves recognition for taking bold risks and largely succeeding. It may show a few rough edges, but those imperfections only highlight how daring and influential the game was, cementing its legacy as a cornerstone of action-adventure gaming history.
