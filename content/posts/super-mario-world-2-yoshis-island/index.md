## A Unique Yoshi Adventure
Instead of Mario himself, you control various Yoshis who escort Baby Mario through imaginative, hand-drawn worlds, the game's unique art style, creative level design, and introduction of mechanics like egg-throwing and flutter jumping give it a distinct identity. Its difficulty ramps up in later stages, offering a solid challenge. With memorable bosses, tight controls, and a whimsical soundtrack, Yoshi’s Island remains a beloved and influential classic of the 16-bit era. One of my favorite mechanics are the vehicle transformations, which produce some unique gameplay sequences.

## Pure Childhood Magic
I consider this my "childhood game", and even today I consider it one of the best games of all time, simply because I can't see a single thing on it that is not completely unique and creative. It lacks on nothing when it comes to the objective of a video-game, which is to be fun and entertaining, it's music will forever be stuck in your brain, not just that but the sound effects, the enemies and the overall original styling.

## Enduring Legacy & Mods
It is a shame that Nintendo rarely tries to replicate and continue with good ideas, so they don't really develop several sequels to their games like other companies do (Ubisoft), so if you want more of this I highly recommend looking for ROM hacks, which, similar to Super Mario World, is a whole universe onto itself. This one is a must play for the SNES platform, and I consider it one of the best games of all time.
