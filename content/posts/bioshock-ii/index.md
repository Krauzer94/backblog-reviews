## Empowered Return to Rapture
BioShock 2 builds on the eerie underwater dystopia of Rapture with improved combat and a deeper emotional story, improving in almost every aspect of it's predecessor. This time, you play as a prototype Big Daddy, which blew a lot of people's minds at the time, adding weight and power to your arsenal. The ability to dual-wield plasmids and weapons enhances gameplay fluidity, and the new hacking mini-game is faster and more intuitive. The story doesn't quite match the philosophical punch of the original, and this is why I prefer the first entry.

## Personal, Not Revolutionary
But it explores parenthood and identity in compelling ways, especially through the bond with Little Sisters. The atmosphere remains hauntingly beautiful, though less groundbreaking than BioShock 1, which is understandable because it didn't really focused on improving the visuals as much as it focused in the gameplay. While not as revolutionary as its predecessor, BioShock 2 is a solid, well-crafted sequel that offers both action and narrative depth, it is hard not to get sold when you simply introduce the idea of playing as a Big Daddy.
