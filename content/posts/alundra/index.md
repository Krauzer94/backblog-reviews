## Dreams and Darkness
This title is a top-down action-adventure game often compared to The Legend of Zelda, but with a darker tone and more mature themes, the MC is a young hero who can enter people’s dreams, exploring surreal, puzzle-filled dungeons tied to their subconscious fears. This was a very unique concept, and fortunately I managed to get myself a fan-made translated version of it, to Portuguese Brazilian, so I could understand what was going on in the story, this is how popular this game was here at the time. The game stands out for its challenging puzzles, rich storytelling, and emotional depth, its sprite-based graphics are detailed and atmospheric, and the soundtrack enhances the melancholy tone.

## Challenging Cult Classic
However, the high difficulty level, especially of the puzzles, can be frustrating for some players, even for today's standards, not to mention the language barrier I faced before I got my hands on the translated version, practically an impossible task to go through all of the game without understanding a word of it. Overall, Alundra is a cult classic, beloved for its ambitious design and mature narrative, and is a must-play for fans of action RPGs who enjoy a challenge and like the PlayStation 2D aesthetic, which is my case. I also recommend playing the second title, though this one is a standout, it is way superior than the sequel, I don't consider the second title a must play, but this one definitely is.
