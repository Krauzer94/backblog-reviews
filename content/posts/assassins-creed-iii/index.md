## Revolutionary New Direction
This AC entry takes the series to 18th-century Colonial America, offering a bold new setting during the American Revolution, continuing the trend of exploring humanity's past, even though the main story was technically finished. The MC this time is called Connor, a half-Mohawk, half-English Assassin caught between two worlds and ideologies. The game introduces expansive wilderness exploration, naval combat, and a revamped combat and parkour system. Technically, it’s a big leap forward, with impressive visuals, weather effects, and a living open world that feels more reactive than before.

## Pacing and Character Issues
However, the game stumbles in pacing, its prologue is notoriously long, taking several hours before you even play as the main character, which at the time was not a problem but it is notable for today's standards. Connor, while noble and stoic, lacks the charisma of previous protagonists like Ezio, making it harder to connect with him emotionally. Some missions feel restrictive or tedious, and the story, while ambitious, occasionally drags or feels disconnected from the series' core narrative.

## Flawed but Influential
Despite its flaws, AC III remains a significant entry in the franchise, laying the groundwork for future gameplay mechanics and delivering memorable moments—especially at sea. It's a game full of good ideas that don't always come together cleanly but still offers a worthwhile experience for fans of the series. One of the best entries, especially when compared to the some of the subsequent ones which were disasters.
