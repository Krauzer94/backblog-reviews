## Magical Puzzle Adventure
Trine is a charming and visually enchanting puzzle-platformer that blends side-scrolling action with clever physics-based challenges. Set in a beautifully rendered fantasy world (which we are never told the name), the game features three distinct characters, a knight, a thief, and a wizard, each with unique abilities that players must switch between to solve puzzles and navigate obstacles. The game's strongest points are its vibrant art style, atmospheric music, and the satisfying interplay of character skills.

## Co-Op Fantasy Fun
The physics engine allows for creative problem-solving, though sometimes the controls and hit detection can feel imprecise, especially in combat. I highly recommend playing this with a friend in coop, even if remotely (Steam Remote Play, Parsec, etc) unfortunately this was not the case for me, although it is still a very enjoyable experience if played alone. Overall, Trine delivers a magical and engaging experience, particularly in co-op play, and laid the foundation for a successful indie franchise, which build upon it's foundations to create much better games along the years.
