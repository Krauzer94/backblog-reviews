## Physics-Driven Revolution
Half-Life 2 is a landmark first-person shooter developed by Valve, it blends intense action, smart puzzle-solving, and a richly atmospheric world, with a very innovative (at the time) mechanic that lets you feel the weight of the objects. The MC is the same as the first title, Gordon Freeman, a silent protagonist navigating the dystopian City 17 under alien rule. The game introduced the revolutionary Source engine, enabling realistic physics, facial animations, and dynamic environments, most memorably showcased with the Gravity Gun, which was a perfect fit for the aforementioned weight mechanics.

## Subtle Immersive Storytelling
The storytelling is immersive and subtle, unfolding through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. The AI, voice acting, and environmental design all contribute to a strong sense of place and tension. While some mechanics show their age today, the core experience remains compelling. This is still one of the most influential games up to this day, and one of the best media of all time, it created a whole genre of "Half-Likes" which have a lot of indie games that are inspired by it today, I highly recommend searching for those if you like HL2.

## Timeless Shooter Masterpiece
I won't spoil anything but, this game has one of the most memorable chapters in shooter gaming history, such as Nova Prospect. Unfortunately the triple A industry doesn't develop these kinds of shooters anymore, so we need to rely on indie devs to deliver them. HL2 was one of the first games I've ever played on a computer, and I could already tell at the time that this was going to be a game that marked it's presence in gaming history by the level of quality it had, it was impressive even at the time, this is truly a masterpiece and a must-play for the PC platform.
