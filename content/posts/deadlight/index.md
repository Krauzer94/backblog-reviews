## Shadows of Seattle
This game is a side-scrolling cinematic platformer set in a bleak, post-apocalyptic 1986 Seattle overrun by zombies, referred to as "shadows." The MC is called Randall Wayne, a survivor searching for his family amidst the ruins. The game stands out for its moody, silhouetted art style and environmental storytelling, evoking a strong Limbo-meets-Prince of Persia vibe.

## Style Over Substance
While its atmosphere and visuals are striking, the gameplay can feel stiff, and the platforming occasionally clunky. It’s a short experience, but one that delivers a somber and visually memorable journey. As already said, the standout really is the visuals, which was what made me want to play it, though, everything else is pretty much only decent enough I'd say, overall a good platformer.
