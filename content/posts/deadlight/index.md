## Shadows of Seattle
This game is a side-scrolling cinematic platformer set in a bleak, post-apocalyptic 1986 Seattle overrun by zombies, referred to as "shadows." The MC is called Randall Wayne, a survivor searching for his family amidst the ruins. The game stands out for its moody, silhouetted art style and environmental storytelling, evoking a strong Limbo-meets-Prince of Persia vibe.

## Style Over Substance
While its atmosphere and visuals are striking, the gameplay can feel stiff, and the platforming occasionally clunky. It’s a short experience, but one that delivers a somber and visually memorable journey. As already said, the standout really is the visuals, which was what made me want to play it, though, everything else is pretty much only decent enough I'd say, overall a good platformer.

## Quiet Despair Narrative
As for the narrative, it leans heavily into quiet despair rather than action-driven storytelling. Much of the MC's past and the state of the world are revealed through journals, background details, and sparse dialogue, which helps reinforce the feeling of isolation. It doesn’t always land with emotional impact, but there’s a grounded, human tone to the writing that fits the setting well, making the journey feel personal despite its limited scope.

## Mood Over Mechanics
Mechanically, it clearly favors tension over power fantasy, combat is deliberately limited and often awkward by design, encouraging avoidance and careful movement instead of direct confrontation. This can be frustrating at times, especially when paired with imprecise controls, but it also strengthens the survivalist tone. In the end, this title feels like a game best appreciated for its mood and presentation rather than its mechanics, a flawed but atmospheric experience that leaves a lasting visual impression.
