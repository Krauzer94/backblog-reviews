## Retro-Inspired 2D Platformer
This title is a lovingly crafted 2D platformer that channels the energy and spirit of the 1990s with remarkable authenticity. It draws clear inspiration from genre greats like Donkey Kong Country and Rayman, but manages to carve out its own charm through sharp design and an endearing presentation. The MC is called Kaze, a brave rabbit who embarks on a quest to save her friend Hogo from a mysterious curse that has corrupted the Crystal Islands. The premise is simple and intentionally retro, setting the stage for a series of challenging, tightly designed levels that feel like a direct homage to the golden era of side-scrolling platformers. I'm a little biased since the studio behind this title is from Brazil, but I sincerely think this is one of the best indies that I've ever played.

## Fluid, Varied Gameplay
Gameplay is where it truly shines, the controls are precise and responsive, allowing for fluid movement and quick reactions, an essential trait for a game that frequently tests your timing and platforming precision. Each stage introduces new mechanics or obstacles, keeping the pace lively and avoiding repetition. The “Wild Masks” mechanic adds welcome variety, letting you temporarily adopt new animal forms such as a tiger that sprints up walls, a shark that swims swiftly underwater, an eagle that glides through aerial levels, and a lizard that dashes through auto-run sections. These transformations not only diversify the gameplay but also infuse the adventure with a sense of discovery and excitement, as you adapt to new styles of movement and combat.

## Vibrant Visuals and Music
Visually, the game is a delight, its hand-drawn pixel art is bursting with color and detail, capturing lush jungles, eerie ruins, and shimmering underwater zones with impressive craftsmanship. Animations are smooth and expressive, giving both Kaze and her enemies personality. The OST complements the visuals perfectly, offering upbeat melodies and atmospheric tunes that shift naturally with each environment. Together, these elements create a sense of warmth and familiarity that’s both nostalgic and fresh, as if you’re playing a lost SNES classic that’s been remade with modern polish.

## Retro Design Challenges
Despite all its strengths, this title isn’t without its flaws, its devotion to retro design means it doesn’t break much new ground; many of its ideas and level structures will feel instantly recognizable to seasoned platformer fans. The game’s difficulty can also be punishing, especially in later levels or bonus challenges, relying on memorization and split-second timing. I admit that I consider myself a platforming veteran but I still struggled trying to play the end-game levels. Some people might find this frustrating, while others will see it as a rewarding callback to the tough-but-fair standards of 90s gaming.

## Craftsmanship and Heart
Ultimately, this title Wild Masks succeeds because of its craftsmanship and heart. It doesn’t try to reinvent the genre, but rather celebrates it with confidence and precision. Every jump, enemy placement, and power-up feels carefully considered, and the game radiates a clear love for the classics that inspired it. For people who grew up on 16-bit adventures, like myself, or anyone craving a polished, challenging platformer with timeless appeal, this game is a hidden gem that deserves attention. This is definitely a must-play if you like platformers to any extent, and obviously if you like the games that inspired this one. I recommend doing 100% since it is a very short and simple title, and it feels like it was made with this intention in mind.
