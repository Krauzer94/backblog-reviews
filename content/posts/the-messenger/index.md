## Retro Evolution Gameplay
This videogame is a retro-inspired action platformer that begins as a straightforward, tightly designed 8-bit side-scroller before transforming into a more expansive Metroidvania-style adventure. Its sharp controls and acrobatic mechanics make traversal and combat consistently satisfying, while the time-traveling twist between 8-bit and 16-bit eras keeps the gameplay and presentation fresh.

## Humor and Soundtrack
The game’s humor and witty writing stand out, with self-aware dialogue that playfully pokes fun at genre conventions. Its soundtrack is a highlight, shifting seamlessly alongside the visuals between eras and giving each area a memorable energy. I genuinely consider the OST of this game one of the best of all time in gaming history, to the same level of old time classics, or even something like Undertale and Deltarune.

## Polarizing Second Half
While a lot of people praise its creativity and polish, some feel the second half slows down due to backtracking and limited fast travel. Though fortunately for me, I'm quite the opposite when it comes to this aspect, similar to something like SOTN (spoilers ahead) when you reach the upside-down Dracula Castle, it was as mind-blowing as when the (more spoilers) the MC opens up the scroll he is carrying, mid-way through the game.

## Beloved Indie Masterpiece
Still, the charm, challenge, and clever design cement it as one of the most beloved indie releases of its year, earning strong critical acclaim and a dedicated fanbase. I consider this one of the best games that I've ever played, it has an insane level if quality on every aspect it tries to convey, exploration is one of it's best elements, you have a lot of movement abilities to play around. One of the standouts of this game is the humor, I laughed really hard in some sections, there are no cheap unfunny jokes, at least for my taste of humor, this was perfect, not to mention the amazing 4th wall break it happens sometimes.

## Unforgettable Complete Experience
This is one of those games that I wish I could forget everything about just so I could play it all over again, for the first time, this is how good this title is. I highly recommend doing 100% on this one, it is one of the most satisfying 100% I've done in a while. I also advise not skipping the DLC, it is fairly short but still carries the amazing quality of the base game. And finally, don't sleep on Sea of Stars, it lives in the same universe of this game, while also being developed by the same devs, and finally, it is as good as this one.
