## Stylish Yet Frustrating Reboot
This game is a stylish 2D side-scrolling reboot of the BloodRayne series, ditching its previous 3D action roots for a hand-drawn, gothic comic-book aesthetic, though I admit that this was my first BloodRayne title. The game is visually impressive, with fluid animations and a distinct art style that makes every frame look sharp and alive. However, this visual polish is heavily undermined by slippery controls and punishing level design.

## Punishing Design Flaws
Rayne’s default sprinting makes her feel difficult to control with precision, especially during the game’s demanding platforming sections, enemy encounters are relentless, and the lack of variety in both foes and environments makes the experience feel repetitive after a few stages. Difficulty spikes and unfair checkpoint placements are frustrating, often forcing long replays after minor mistakes. The game had potential, but for many, and this is why I couldn't finish it and I would only recommend this for hardcore fans of BloodRayne in general.
