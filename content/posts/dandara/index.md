## Warp-Based Exploration
This title is a Metroidvania with a unique twist on movement. Instead of running and jumping in the traditional sense, the player warps between surfaces, floor, walls, and ceilings, creating a distinctive flow and rhythm in exploration and combat. This mechanic gives the game a fresh feel within the genre.

## Atmospheric Brazilian Influence
The game excels in atmosphere, featuring detailed pixel art and haunting sound design that immerse the player in the surreal world of Salt. Exploration is rewarding, with secrets, upgrades, and hidden paths that encourage curiosity. The game also carries subtle Brazilian cultural influences, adding personality and depth to its artistic presentation. I'm biased since this is my home country, but I can't recommend this title enough if you have any curiosity regarding our culture and folklore.

## Challenging Movement Drawbacks
However, the unconventional movement can feel imprecise, especially in combat or tight platforming sections, leading to occasional frustration. It is also relatively short, and some sections in the mid-to-late-game can feel punishing due to spikes in difficulty. The story is minimal, serving more as a backdrop than a narrative driver, which may disappoint people looking for strong storytelling.

## Standout Indie Metroidvania
Overall, this game is a memorable indie Metroidvania that stands out for its movement mechanics, aesthetic, and exploration. It’s best suited for people who enjoy challenge, discovery, and unique gameplay experiences, even if it occasionally tests patience. This is one of the best indies I've ever played of this genre, I highly recommend not skipping it if you like Metroidvanias to any extent.
