## Birth of Survival Horror
This Capcom classic is a landmark survival horror game that defined the genre, set in the eerie Spencer Mansion, you control Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine as they unravel a zombie outbreak linked to the sinister Umbrella Corporation. The game combines tense atmosphere, limited resources, puzzle-solving, and tank controls to create a sense of vulnerability and dread. Despite stiff voice acting and clunky dialogue (“You were almost a Jill sandwich!”), it’s a haunting, unforgettable classic that laid the foundation for one of gaming’s most iconic franchises, a must-play for fans of horror and one of the best titles in the PlayStation platform.

## Fear, Replayability, Legacy
I remember not being able to get past the first few rooms of this game when I played it as a teen, it was simply the most terrifying video-game ever made at the time, which was later surpassed by it's future sequels in every way, but the fear was always there. I love how Capcom manages to add replayability to their games, and make it fun enough for you to not care that the games aren't really that long, since you can always replay it afterwards to try and find more things you didn't see. On this particular one you can unlock different costumes, which was later implemented into other titles of the franchise, and also of a lot of other Capcom's franchises, a trademark of this company.
