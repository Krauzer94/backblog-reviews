## Defining Rail Shooter
This game is a standout 3D rail shooter that became one of the defining titles of the Nintendo 64 era. As a reboot of the original Star Fox for the SNES, it builds on the core formula with fully voiced characters, cinematic storytelling, and polished gameplay. The MC is called Fox McCloud and his team as they battle across the Lylat System, piloting the Arwing, military spaceships, through a series of diverse and action-packed missions.

## Iconic Gameplay Variety
It has amazing tight controls, fast-paced combat, and iconic voice lines like the unforgettable “Do a barrel roll!”, which I finally experienced after knowing about it for several years. Its branching level paths offer multiple routes and endings, greatly increasing its replay value. Ground and tank-based missions add variety, while boss fights are consistently creative and satisfying, there is even an underwater level in which you pilot a submarine.

## Challenging Branching Paths
I played all the 15 available levels and got the secret ending, by going the "hard route", which is the one at the left corner, and it indeed is way harder than the regular one. I highly recommend playing all the levels since they are very satisfying and unique enough that are worth experiencing, even though they are tough as nails if you are not used to rail shooters, even more so because this is a 3D one.

## Enduring N64 Classic
And while I admit that I didn't 100% this title, I still enjoyed the hell out of every minute, so much so that I even added the SNES version to my backlog, which is something I never thought of doing since I am really not a fan of rail shooters. This title is a must play solely because of it's influence and gaming history, and while the campaign is relatively short, its charm, replayability, and tight design make it a beloved classic and one of the N64’s essential titles.
