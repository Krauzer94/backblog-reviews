## Futuristic Run-And-Gun
This title is a fast-paced 2D action game set in a futuristic world, the MC is called Xoda Rap as she battles robotic invaders in a series of colorful, chaotic levels. The game is immediately striking for its fluid, hand-drawn pixel art and energetic animation style that evokes classic run-and-gun titles from the 16-bit era. Its standout feature is the unique control scheme, which combines mouse-based targeting with rapid movement, allowing you to dash, attack, and combo enemies in a highly dynamic way.

## Relentless Retro Action
The pacing is relentless, keeping you constantly on the move as the screen fills with enemies, explosions, and projectiles. Each stage offers distinct challenges and clever design twists, capped off with inventive boss fights that demand quick reflexes and adaptability. The soundtrack complements the fast action with upbeat, catchy tunes that fit the retro aesthetic perfectly. It's unique control scheme is what made me want to play this, but I played it until the end because of it's charming art-style and high quality soundtrack.

## Short but Stylish
On the downside, the game’s short length is its biggest flaw, it can be completed in a few hours, making this feel like an arcade title of some sorts, so if you are not into those kinds of games than I would skip this one. Its difficulty also ramps up sharply, which may frustrate casual people, and the unconventional controls can take some time to master. Still, once the rhythm clicks, it becomes a rewarding experience. Overall, this game is a love letter to classic arcade action, filled with charm, creativity, and intense gameplay.
