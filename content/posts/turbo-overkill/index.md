## Neon Boomer Shooter
This title is a retro-inspired first-person shooter that blends classic “boomer shooter” energy with modern design. Set in a neon-soaked cyberpunk world, it delivers fast movement, wall-running, grappling hooks, and an arsenal full of outrageous weapons — including a chainsaw leg for stylish melee kills. The combat is chaotic, over-the-top, and satisfying, with plenty of secrets and modifiers that keep the action varied. Its soundtrack mixes heavy metal and electronic beats, amplifying the intensity, while the visuals strike a strong balance between old-school grit and modern flair.

## Chaotic High-Speed Action
On the downside, some people find the levels confusing to navigate, with sign-posting not always clear in the middle of the frenetic action. The sheer speed and density of mechanics may overwhelm people who prefer slower, more methodical shooters. Overall, this game is a high-octane experience that excels at delivering raw shooter fun. If you enjoy games like Dusk or Ultrakill and crave even more speed and spectacle, this is an excellent pick. If you prefer tighter pacing or clearer structure, it might feel a bit too chaotic.

## A Standout Shooter
For fans of boomer shooters, this is definitely a standout, I consider this one of the best of it's kind. The level of chaos and movement mechanics is very advanced, and it's difficulty is also something that I really enjoy. It'll never feel unfair, but at the same time, it is not a walk in the park, so if you are not fond to challenging titles, than look elsewhere. I highly recommend this for fans of the boomer shooter genre, or shooters in general, this is definitely one of the best. I'm biased but it's soundtrack, being mainly Synthwave, is an absolute killer one.
