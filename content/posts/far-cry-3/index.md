## Survival in Paradise
The third Far Cry entry is a gripping open-world first-person shooter that stands out for its lush tropical setting, intense action, and surprisingly strong narrative, especially for the standards of shooters at the time, not to mention also compared to Far Cry itself up until that point. The MC is called Jason Brody, a tourist stranded on a lawless island, forced to evolve from a scared outsider into a ruthless survivor.

## Freedom Through Chaos
The game's biggest strength lies in its freedom, whether you approach combat with stealth or all guns blazing, and this game is one of those that started this trend at the time, the illusion of freedom hiding behind two options. The sandbox mechanics are incredibly satisfying, with the hunting challenges being a standout in my opinion.

## An Iconic Villain
Its villain, Vaas Montenegro, remains iconic thanks to a chilling performance and memorable writing, even for today's standards, one of the best villains of all time in gaming history. Though some mission pacing issues and repetitive side content show their age, Far Cry 3 still holds up as a defining entry in the series and a classic of its generation, it is one of the best shooters of all time, I highly recommend not skipping this one.
