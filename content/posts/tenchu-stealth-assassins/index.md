## Stealth, Flaws, Legacy
The game has a tense, tactical gameplay, unique grappling hook mechanics, which was later copied from other titles, and the sense of agency it gave players in approaching missions, however, it suffered from clunky controls and a rough camera, which were common issues in early 3D games. The soundtrack added to the dark, moody atmosphere, but the voice acting was terrible, laughable, even by the standards at the time, but I cannot complain since this is indeed entertaining and fun to experience, the only decent one being Rikimaru. Despite its flaws, Tenchu became a cult classic and helped define the stealth genre alongside Metal Gear Solid and Thief, it's remembered fondly for its originality and style, a must-play for fans of stealth and/or ninja titles.
