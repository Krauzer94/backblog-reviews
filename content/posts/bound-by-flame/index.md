## Frustrating Combat Start
This title tries to present itself as a gritty, choice-driven RPG, but the first few hours make it hard to stick with. The combat is clumsy and frustrating right from the start, with sluggish controls and awkward mechanics that make even simple encounters feel like a struggle. Instead of learning curves or rewarding fights, the game delivers battles that feel more like a test of patience than skill.

## Flat Storytelling Delivery
The story, while hinting at an interesting conflict between humanity and demonic influence, doesn’t manage to grab attention early on. The dialogue feels flat, and the characters come across as uninteresting, making it difficult to care about what’s happening. The voice acting and stiff presentation only add to the sense that the world lacks energy or personality.

## Unfulfilled RPG Potential
After a few hours, it becomes clear that the rough combat, uninspired storytelling, and dull pacing overshadow any potential the game might have had. For many, it’s the kind of RPG that’s easier to set aside than to push through, especially when the opening hours do so little to encourage you to keep going.
