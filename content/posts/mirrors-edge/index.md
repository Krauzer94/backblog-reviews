## Momentum Over Combat
This game is a visually striking first-person parkour game set in a clean, minimalist city. Its standout feature is the movement system, running, wall-running, and fluid acrobatics create a sense of momentum that few games capture. Combat is deliberately limited, encouraging players to avoid fights rather than engage, which adds tension and a unique pacing. This game really feels like you are playing PlayStation 2 Prince of Persia but with the first-person perspective, and it is very well executed, quite unique at the time. The story feels more like a backdrop for the action, which can leave the narrative a bit thin for some players.

## Style Above Story
Controls can feel a bit floaty or imprecise at times, especially with the keyboard, which may frustrate newcomers. Despite these minor flaws, the game’s style, level design, and adrenaline-fueled sequences make it a memorable and refreshing experience that still feels different from most action games today. There are very few characters in the story, and none of them are memorable or charismatic enough, so don't expect a lot on this regard. Still, this is one of the most unique titles that I've ever played and I highly recommend not skipping it.

## Audio-Visual Identity
The audio-visual presentation deserves special mention beyond just the visuals. The stark use of color not only defines the game’s identity but also serves gameplay, subtly guiding the you through environments without intrusive HUD elements. And while nowadays we have a lot of minimal HUD games, this was a standout at the time. The OST is atmospheric and restrained, perfectly matching the sense of isolation and speed as you traverse rooftops high above the city. Sound design reinforces momentum too, with footsteps, slides, and jumps providing constant feedback that keeps you locked into the flow of movement.

## Timeless Creative Risk
From a modern perspective, this title feels like a bold experiment that didn’t care about following trends. Its relatively short length and focus on time trials and replayability make it easy to revisit, especially for those who enjoy mastering levels and shaving seconds off their runs. While it may not fully realize its narrative ambitions, its commitment to a clear gameplay vision is admirable. Even years later, it stands as a reminder that taking creative risks can result in something truly distinctive and enduring.
