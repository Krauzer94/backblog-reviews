## Nostalgic Evolution Concept
The first Evoland entry is a charming indie action-RPG that takes players on a nostalgic journey through the evolution of video games. It starts with simple 2D monochrome graphics and gradually unlocks upgrades, evolving into 16-bit and eventually full 3D visuals as you progress. This is especially nostalgic for me, since I lived through the RPG evolution era, at least from 16-bit an onwards, so I'm a little biased.

## Classic RPG Homage
The gameplay is a playful homage to classic RPGs, including The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Secret of Mana. You experience a mix of real-time and turn-based combat, light puzzles, collectible stars, and even a mini card game inspired by Final Fantasy VIII. The gameplay is constantly changing, which makes it a very dynamic game, even though it is way less dynamic than it's sequel, since it is it's first implementation of the neat ideas this title was trying to convey as an experience.

## Short but Charming
The evolution mechanic is central, gradually introducing new mechanics such as saving points and auto-mapping. While very short (2~3 hours) it shines through its nostalgic charm and whimsical humor. It cleverly parodies gaming tropes and packs a variety of experiences into a compact package, its accessible gameplay make it an inviting choice for fans of retro RPGs.

## Lighthearted Retro Trip
Some people note that the combat and story are relatively simple and the game lacks depth, but most agree that the concept is creative and fun, and again, the sequel is much more developed on every possible aspect. Overall, Evoland works best as a lighthearted, nostalgic trip through RPG history rather than a deep or lengthy adventure, though, if you don't particularly liked this one I still encourage playing the sequel since it is simply a better game.
