## Ambitious Action RPG
Darksiders II expands on the original with a bigger world, deeper RPG mechanics, and faster-paced combat. The MC now is Death, one of the Four Horsemen, in a quest to clear War's name and restore balance. The game blends Hack'n Slash action with dungeon crawling and loot collection, evoking comparisons to Zelda, Diablo, and Prince of Persia. And the comparisons are respectfully earned, since all the gaming industry, and the community, praised this entry as one that has the same level of quality as the franchises in which it was inspired by.

## Rewarding Expansive Journey
While some aspects feel bloated or repetitive, the stylish art direction, varied environments, and fluid traversal make it a memorable ride. It’s an ambitious sequel that mostly delivers, especially for fans of action-adventure hybrids. You can easily spend a very high amount of hours playing this game to unlock everything and explore every bit, similar to something like the Ocarina of Time, I really enjoyed to waste way more time than I expected, and I highly recommend enjoying this one slowly and patiently since it is very rewarding. A must-play for any Hack'n Slash and/or exploration adventure fans.
