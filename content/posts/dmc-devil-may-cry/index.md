## Bold Reimagining of Dante
This DMC entry is a reboot of the classic action series, this time, developed by Ninja Theory, so not Capcom. It reimagines Dante as a younger, edgier antihero in a modern, dystopian setting. The combat is fast, fluid, and stylish, with a blend of angelic and demonic weapons that allow for flashy combos and smooth transitions. This game heavily focuses on "weapon-switching" combos compared to the previous entries, which you couldn't switch weapons on-the-fly. Visually, the game stands out with its surreal, shifting environments and slick presentation, trying to show how the world has badly turned out using a modern urban setting.

## Divisive Yet Excellent
While the tone and character redesigns divided longtime fans, the game itself offers a solid action experience with satisfying mechanics and strong level design. I admit that I was not at all bothered by the change, I quite enjoyed this on and I highly recommend to any Hack'N Slash fan, it is one of the best games I've played of this genre. This is a bold, stylish reboot with tight gameplay, though not without controversy among series purists, and it leaves you with an amazing cliff-hanger at the end which, unfortunately, didn't moved forward since the next entry went back to the traditional "mainline" Dante story again.
