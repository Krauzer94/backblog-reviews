## Polarity-Driven Platforming
This game is a striking blend of fast-paced platforming and Metroidvania-style exploration, wrapped in a bold, silhouette-heavy visual style. Its core mechanic, switching between light and dark energies to counter enemies and navigate bullet-hell patterns, keeps the gameplay dynamic and challenging. While the story is minimal and the checkpoint system can feel punishing at times, the smooth controls and unique polarity-based combat make it a standout. It's a hidden gem that combines old-school design with modern flair, I particularly loved the platforming sections and also the boss fights, they are very unique and creative.
