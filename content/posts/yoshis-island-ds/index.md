## Expanded Yoshi Gameplay
This title is a follow-up to the SNES classic Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island. It keeps the hand-drawn, colorful art style and platforming focused on guiding Yoshis who carry different baby characters (Mario, Peach, DK, Wario, and Bowser). Each baby gives Yoshi unique abilities, which adds variety to the puzzles and level design. This is it's biggest standout compared to the previous title, making the gameplay and levels much more unique in comparison, so if you enjoyed the first one there are no excuses not to play this one too.

## Faithful Yet Flawed
The game plays very similarly to the original, but the dual-screen setup sometimes makes it hard to see hazards above or below, leading to cheap hits. While it doesn’t innovate much beyond the multiple babies mechanic, it’s still a solid and charming platformer with great music and plenty of challenge for completionists. Overall, this is a fun and faithful to the SNES classic, but not as polished or memorable, and I consider this a must-play for fans of platforming in general, truly a classic along with it's predecessor.
