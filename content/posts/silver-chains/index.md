## Frustrating Horror Misfire
A terrible title, really don't recommend this one, the puzzles are bad, the design is bad, cheap jumpscares and the story is obtuse to say the least. I don't know why I bought this game, but I rushed since I knew it is very short, though I didn't knew it was so bad. It tries very hard to replicate some mechanics of games like Outlast, but uses scripted sequences for all the interactive gameplay sections, you are left with the jumpscares and the unfunny puzzles, which I admit that I looked a lot of them online since I was having zero fun, no shame about this.

## Cheap Scripted Scares
There is almost no interaction with the world, the scary sections which you are being chased are almost completely scripted, I highly recommend passing this one. The worst part is that even the atmosphere, which should have been the game’s strongest asset, feels artificial and uninspired. The mansion setting had potential, but instead of building tension through environmental storytelling, it relies on loud noises and things popping up in your face. After the first few cheap scares, you can already predict what’s coming next. There’s no psychological buildup and no subtlety, just repetitive attempts to startle you.

## Hollow On-Rails Horror
The pacing also works against the experience, exploration feels empty and disconnected, with long stretches of walking through nearly identical corridors only to trigger another scripted event. Because so much of the game is on rails, there’s no real sense of danger. You’re not surviving through smart decisions or quick reactions, you’re just moving forward until the next pre-determined scare activates. That makes the horror feel hollow rather than engaging.

## Relief Over Satisfaction
Even visually, while the graphics are decent on a technical level, they can’t compensate for the lack of meaningful gameplay. The character movement feels stiff, interactions are limited, and the overall experience ends up being more frustrating than frightening. By the time the credits rolled, I felt more relieved than satisfied. There are far better horror games out there that respect your time and intelligence, this one is simply not worth it.
