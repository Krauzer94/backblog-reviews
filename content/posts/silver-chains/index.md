## Frustrating Horror Misfire
A terrible title, really don't recommend this one, the puzzles are bad, the design is bad, cheap jumpscares and the story is obtuse to say the least. I don't know why I bought this game, but I rushed since I knew it is very short, though I didn't knew it was so bad. It tries very hard to replicate some mechanics of games like Outlast, but uses scripted sequences for all the interactive gameplay sections, you are left with the jumpscares and the unfunny puzzles, which I admit that I looked a lot of them online since I was having zero fun, no shame about this. There is almost no interaction with the world, the scary sections which you are being chased are almost completely scripted, I highly recommend passing this one.
