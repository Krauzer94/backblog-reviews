## Faithful Modern Remake
This Metroid entry is a masterful remake of the original Metroid (1986), modernizing the classic with tight controls, updated graphics, and expanded lore. It retains the series' signature nonlinear exploration and atmospheric isolation while adding quality-of-life improvements like a map system and smoother combat. The new epilogue sequence featuring Zero Suit Samus is a standout, offering stealth gameplay that adds variety and narrative depth, and this is what sold me to play this game, I highly recommend this solely because of this epilogue, it won't blow your mind but is definitely a must-play.

## Polished Evolution
It's a concise, polished experience that serves as both a perfect entry point for newcomers and a satisfying reimagining for longtime fans. As much as I like the SNES Metroid, this one has better quality overall, the animations, visuals and especially the controls. It makes the SNES one feel clunky at times since this one is a huge step forward when it comes to how the controls feel, they really nailed when developing this one, and the subsequent ones also benefit from this successful implementation.
